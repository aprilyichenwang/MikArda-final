WHAT WE WANT IN A ROOMMATE: Looking for someone who is kind and has a great sense of humor. Needs to be psychologically minded and spiritually oriented. Non-judgmental.

Again, I mention that the alcohol use is very, very limited... that means to limit use to just occasional social drinking in the house if there is a party or dinner. We sometimes have under-age students who live here and I like having a low drinking-zone in the house.

We try to have one Sunday dinner together each month or watch a movie or TV series --- like Game of Thrones. Kitchens are where many of the student roommates hang out . They study together and share food in a relaxed way to develop a real feeling of community. Kitchens upstairs and downstairs. I am the "" in the informal den mother - landlady"" . My kids are grown, but I like living with students . International students are welcome. I strive to have a home, not a boarding house, with a real community feel.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/roo/6070163707.html,*Friendly Small Community forming in North Berkeley or near,,berkeley,,,"['no smoking', 'private bath', 'private room']"," That's my dream... and I'm trying to BRING TOGETHER a small handful of people to make that happen! Unfortunately, there's not a specific CL category for this. But renting places may be relatively easy when the money is pooled among 3 or so people... The HARD part is to find congenial, carefully-chosen people to make a cozy home with! I'm an artist who also does massage and other bodywork, part-time, with a stable, well-paid side job. Originally from Europe but long-time Bay Area resident, and UC Berkeley graduate. I don't know about you, but I'm tired to either live alone, or to have my housing situation at the mercy of the current relationship, or to live with poorly-matched roommates! * CENTRAL POINT => Hence, I want to find about 2 people, CAREFULLY CHOSEN for compatibility and affinity, and THEN (after the people are lined up) find and rent a house or large apartment together! :) Why? Well, when places become available, especially good ones, they go like snow in the sun! At that point, there is no time to line up people! People must be agreed upon, and in a ready state, AHEAD of time. (The alternative? Make a mad scramble, grab the first people and end up with another bad roommate situation! No thanks!) An apt metaphor: ""elective surgery"" vs. ""emergency surgery"" ;) * CURRENT STATUS. So far, I've found one lovely young woman who seems compatible, and we've gotten to know each other over the past couple of months. She is very nice, and it seems very promising... But we almost certainly we need at least another person to pool our resources... (We do NOT come ""as a unit"", just to clarify.) Both of us have OK places we're living in, and can stay in if we want, but we would like to get something better, and with a lovely small community, for a total of 3 - or perhaps 4 - people. Sooner would be better than later... but not at the expense of doing it right!! (please disregard the ""available by"" date; CL forces to put a date.) ~~~~~~~~~~~ Here is my broad VISION: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * NON-SMOKER (if you're trying to quit, I've helped some of my bodywork clients quit...) * LOCATIONS of interest: North Berkeley (one of the world's most beautiful places!), or perhaps other parts of Berkeley, Albany/El Cerrito hills, or Lake Merritt (which I nicknamed ""Berkeley away from Berkeley"" LOL) Those are the most livable places in the central east bay area, IMO - and I've tried them all :) * QUIET in the morning (mornings are for sleeping, as far as I'm concerned!! I'm a card-carrying Night Owl... but I'm quiet in the evening/night, no worries.) * NO DOGS. (I have no pets, not counting my perfectly-behaved and delightfully problem-free toy stuffed animals!) * Other than the above, I'm easygoing: what I care about most is to find FRIENDLY people with WARM energy and excellent COMMUNICATION skills. Is that too much to ask?? ;) I don't think that roommates necessarily need to be good friends, but I'd like them to be people I feel connection with, and who enrich the home environment. In particular, with my favorite past roommate, we enjoyed occasional casual meal sharing. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ If my plan appeals to you, and my broad vision seems compatible with yours, please drop me a line :) ~Julian ==> ***IMPORTANT***: in your reply, please make sure to ADDRESS ME BY NAME (""Hi Julian"")... so, I'll have more confidence that you actually read this ad, and that you're not a spammer - I get many of those...

I'm subletting a bedroom with a 1 year lease beginning as early as May 20th in my two-bedroom apartment. The apartment is located on Shattuck and Dwight five blocks from the downtown Berkeley BART station. The landlord remodeled the unit before I moved in a few years ago... new countertops and kitchen appliances, hardwood floors and tons of natural light. The apartment was a one-bedroom until the landlord put up a wall in the living room to make the second bedroom. The apartment is pretty small... I'm talking European small... I'd say about 350 square feet. It's fully furnished with the exception of the available room. The apartment has limited storage space so if you have lots of belongings, getting a separate storage unit would be in order. There's one shared bathroom and street parking with a permit from the city. Rent is allocated proportionally... the large bedroom is 10' x 12' has its own closet and costs $900 per month. Utilities are separate... about $40 each per month. The security deposit is $775. This space is a toxic free / healthy living environment. That means there is no microwave or teflon coated pans in the kitchen, we turn WIFI off at night and we don't use or store toxic chemicals (synthetic cleaners, bleach, artificial dish soap, paint, Febreze, etc.) in the apartment. Natural dish soap and natural cleaning products are used instead when possible. You would be sharing the apartment with me -- I live in the smaller room. I'm a 28-year-old male and I work as a news writer and producer. I have a pretty stressful job and I like to unwind with gravity bong rips in the living room. Just kidding... I don't smoke pot and I'm looking for someone who doesn't toke reefer in the apartment. I want a housemate who likes to socialize occasionally, is clean, responsible and pays rent on time. I keep the apartment pretty tidy and I'm looking for someone who wants to live in a clean environment. The room is available for a yearlong sublease with a possible extension as I plan on eventually turning that bedroom into an office.

I'm subletting a bedroom with a 1 year lease beginning as early as May 20th in my two-bedroom apartment. The apartment is located on Shattuck and Dwight five blocks from the downtown Berkeley BART station. The landlord remodeled the unit before I moved in a few years ago... new countertops and kitchen appliances, hardwood floors and tons of natural light. The apartment was a one-bedroom until the landlord put up a wall in the living room to make the second bedroom. The apartment is pretty small... I'm talking European small... I'd say about 350 square feet. It's fully furnished with the exception of the available room. The apartment has limited storage space so if you have lots of belongings, getting a separate storage unit would be in order. There's one shared bathroom and street parking with a permit from the city. Rent is allocated proportionally... the large bedroom is 10' x 12' has its own closet and costs $900 per month. Utilities are separate... about $40 each per month. The security deposit is $775. This space is a toxic free / healthy living environment. That means there is no microwave or teflon coated pans in the kitchen, we turn WIFI off at night and we don't use or store toxic chemicals (synthetic cleaners, bleach, artificial dish soap, paint, Febreze, etc.) in the apartment. Natural dish soap and natural cleaning products are used instead when possible. You would be sharing the apartment with me -- I live in the smaller room. I'm a 28-year-old male and I work as a news writer and producer. I have a pretty stressful job and I like to unwind with gravity bong rips in the living room. Just kidding... I don't smoke pot and I'm looking for someone who doesn't toke reefer in the apartment. I want a housemate who likes to socialize occasionally, is clean, responsible and pays rent on time. I keep the apartment pretty tidy and I'm looking for someone who wants to live in a clean environment. The room is available for a yearlong sublease with a possible extension as I plan on eventually turning that bedroom into an office. Feel free to email me with a bit about yourself, what you're looking for and your phone number. ",37.8664,-122.257

(Couples welcome) May Move-in,1050.0,oakland lake merritt / grand,,,"['laundry on site', 'private bath', 'private room']"," Hello! I'm looking to share my very large two bedroom/two bath apartment in Lake Merritt about 7 to 8 blocks (depending on which direction you go) from the lake itself. The neighborhood is pretty safe. There is an active community garden across the street and a bus line right in front of the building and with street parking available. There is currently a waiting list for a parking space inside the garage. As I mentioned the apartment is very large with a balcony overlooking the neighborhood and you can see the tall buildings of downtown Oakland in the distance. I don't have a lot of furniture, so if you do- great! The bedroom is approximately 12' x 12' with a window and a large mirrored closet with plenty more closet space in the hallway. There is a semi-private full bathroom. The bathroom is in the hallway that bathroom would be the one guests would use if necessary. As for me, I'm an educated African-American woman in her 40's. I'm an aspiring novelist working in an office in the city until I can write full time. :-) I'm pretty chill and laid-back (but not a push-over!) When I'm home, I'm usually reading, writing, or watching something online. I'm friendly and like to talk, however, I like my alone time as well and really good at picking up social cues if my roommate doesn't want to talk. :-) I'm looking for a stable, mature person as a roommate (couples are welcome, too). I highly prefer roommate references, if possible. I understand someone may not have them (e.g. has never shared an apartment before, moving from personal long- term situation, etc.) I'd like to have someone long-term. Roommate searching is a drag and I'd like to have some stability so I can concentrate on creative endeavors. I am not looking for any particular type of person as a roommate but my five must-haves are: Thoughtful Considerate Respectful Responsible and Communicative Now for the money part! ($$) Rent is $1,050 per month for a single individual, $1,150 for a couple. This includes Wi-fi. Utilities (PG&E) will be split either in half or in thirds (if there is a couple). If you wish to have cable television and/or a cleaning service, that is something we can discuss. Move-In costs are first and last month's rent and a security deposit of $600. Thanks for reading! The room will be available as of May 13th (or sooner). If you're interested, please feel free to drop me a line and tell me a little about yourself and the kind of living situation you're looking for. I look forward to meeting you!

We're all women, and due to the shared space we're looking for a housemate who is also, or non-binary or genderqueer. Your bathroom is shared (usually with just one housemate but she prefers to share her bathroom with another woman). (Please note that Fair Housing laws state that ""advertising which expresses a preference based upon sex is allowed in shared living situations where tenants will share a bathroom, kitchen, or other common area."" -- and in this case all of these are shared). We host occasional house concerts (about 2x per year). Small 8x8 garden room available (attached to the house, with its own sliding glass door to the back yard as well as a regular door to the house, built-in shelves, bamboo floors, and furnished with a full-size murphy bed and optional small table). The Garden Room is 695/mo mo. for lease through August 2018 (745/mo if shorter), renewable yearly if it's a good fit for all. This rent includes storage space in your room, a small amount of kitchen space for your food/kitchen items, and plenty of bathroom space for toiletries, as well as yard space. But our living and dining room mostly contain our furniture, and aren't generally available for storage, which is why this room is more affordable than most. If you need extra space outside of your room, we could do some rearranging to make it happen, in which case the monthly rent would be a bit more (depending on how much extra space). Rent reduced to 595 with 3 hrs/mo of CMT (if you're a CMT with experience treating Myfascial TOS and ankle tendonitis). Please respond only if it all feels like truly a match for you (to help with that, the ad's so detailed it's practically a novel -- and please read it all before responding). Hardwood floors, bamboo eco-kitchen/laundry, back & front yard, trees! Your bathroom (shared usually with 1 other, and with guests) has blue & white tile shower + bathtub, glass blocks, earthy-green-porcelain tile floor, large mahogany countertop, lots of cabinet space, 1 window etc. Own phone line available in the room Rent includes high-speed internet. EBMUD/PGE is additional (average 50-55/mo). Rent includes garbage service Extra plus for those who love nature: not only would you enjoy this awesome house in Berkeley, but also while renting here you'd get discount stays at the Clear Air Mountain House, a fragrance-free LGBT-friendly retreat space in the Sierras, near the Yuba River, waterfalls, Pacific Crest Trail, Sierra Hot Springs, and over 45 lakes! That includes discounted work-trade stays too (just 2 hrs per night's lodging or 1 hr for CMT). We go there often and sometimes carpool from Berkeley. You: queer-friendly nonsmoking woman or genderqueer or non-binary person, honest, clean & responsible, considerate, respectful of quiet hours when others are sleeping, friendly, not a heavy partier, & enjoy women singer/songwriter music (we all volunteer to help the house concerts happen, so our first choice would be a housemate who's enthusiastic about the concerts & would like to be involved behind the scenes). No musical ability is required at all to live here, but enthusiasm's a plus :o) We're looking for a housemate who is a mature (in behavior) adult, with honesty, integrity, and good communication skills. Us: All of the above. 45 y.o. Singer/Songwriter/Counselor, and a 50 y.o environmental science student who also works at Tilden Park. Also, part-time housemates include: A 41 y.o. self-identified tech geek who lives at the house approximately half-time (sometimes less, sometimes more) and a 52-y.o. electrician who mostly lives in the South Bay but stays with us an average of a few days a month. We're a multicultural house and we all love music and nature. We're busy but friendly (greet each other, sometimes have conversations and spontaneous socializing, but with it's also a space where friendly introverts can have space). One of us (the one who has lived here the longest) has Multiple Chemical Sensitivities including severe allergies to all tobacco & pot smoke (even if you smoke outdoors it would affect me), perfume, incense, patchouli, lavender-essential-oil (& many other flowery essential oils), scented hair-oil/leave-on-conditioner, hairspray, fabric softener residue, chemicals, etc., so please be a nonsmoker who doesn't wear fragrances (it's sad to be allergic to one's housemate -- so this one's not negotiable -- so if you wear perfume or smoke even occasionally, even outdoors, it wouldn't be a fit). Please share in your response how this fragrance-free policy fits with your own lifestyle. Quiet hours are 11 or 11:30pm-8am weekdays, 11:30-8:30am Fridays, 12-9am weekends/holidays. Unfortunately, early-morning showers wake up and keep up the light sleeper whose room is adjacent to the showers, so looking for a housemate who doesn't mind not showering before 8am weekdays/9am weekends/holidays. It's a beautiful craftsman house (not an apartment)! The spacious living/dining room is where volunteer-run volunteer-hosted women's house concerts take place about once every few months. Hardwood floors, mahogany wood paneling, beautiful art on the walls & an upright piano too! Environmentally friendly large newish eco-kitchen (bamboo cabinets by Alter-Eco, bamboo-floor, granite countertops), eco-washer/dryer, energy star range/stove/hood, dishwasher, & a cool reverse-osmosis-water-filter! 2 bathrooms, front vegetable/herb garden & back yard -- we have a peach tree and beautiful purple flowering vine, trees, a hammock, & more space to garden. We also have a stationary cycle for exercising indoors on rainy days. We're in North Berkeley, a very nice tree-lined area of Berkeley right near public transit, less than a mile from No. Berkeley BART, 1 mile from UC, & 3 miles from Tilden Park with hiking, lake swimming. Close to shops, restaurants, ""gourmet ghetto,"" Live Oak Park, etc.. Nature & convenience! A few steps from FatApple's restaurant. Sorry, no furry pets due to allergies. More about Rose Street's occasional concerts: Rose Street House of Music is a volunteer-run volunteer-hosted house concert & grassroots musical community featuring women singer-songwriters. Rose Street brings out women's voices through poetic music of substance & depth. All genders are welcome as audience, volunteers, & back-up musicians for the artists we feature. We realize this is way more specific than many houses, but we want to share the roommate compatibility info upfront to save everyone time. If this all is a great fit for you, please email for more info. If it's not a good fit, we ask that you please choose other places, because it's important to us that everyone be happy living here. We tend to receive a lot of responses based on price/location alone, so we're sorry but we won't be responding to generic inquiries. If you respond, please let us know why you feel this house is a good fit (besides the price and location). Please state ""Rose Street home"" in the subject (so we know the response is from a person and not a spam-bot :o) Please also include your email address in the email (for some reason, when we reply to the CL replies it doesn't always go through).

I can offer under six months/month to month go as you know agreements. Also I have a small dog who does not fancy cats. This 2bed 2bath apartment is in a building with a beautiful courtyard and pool in Berkeley. I'm looking for the right roommate, kind, creative, good communicator. I am flexible in terms because who I live with is important to me. I keep the kitchen pretty busy in general because I cook most meals and often make large batches of things too. I also have an 8 lbs dog. Sweet and spunky. He is black with long hair, no fur, doesn't shed. I'm looking to live with someone who is chill with the dog and down to take some walks sometimes.

More about the place. It's centrally located It is 3 blocks north of Berkeley Bowl on Shattuck on a quiet block 10 minute walk to UC Berkeley and both Downtown Berkeley bart and to Ashby bart. Ten minutes to the highways. Busses on this block The unit gets plenty of light and the place is fun, lots of art supplies and different things to enjoy. Random example, I have a couple of different kinds of kaleidoscopes from the largest kaleidoscope gallery in the world out in Jerome, Arizona. I like fun simple things and I have a similar approach to life. The kitchen is a good one and I'm always making food. I like foodie people. There is a garbage disposal, dish washer, and I also keep a vita mix and some food dehydrators along with the more basic appliances like the toaster and coffee maker. The building is gated, has laundry, pool, and has a pretty jungle like courtyard I am 29, graduate of UC Berkeley, into good food and healthy living, dancing, conversations, kick its, hikes, rollerblading, and road trips.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/roo/6101330844.html,Artsy attic room in fragrance-free house,795.0,berkeley,,,"['furnished', 'laundry on site', 'no smoking', 'street parking', 'no private bath', 'private room']"," Artsy attic room in a beautiful fragrance-free smoke-free North Berkeley house, hardwood floors, eco-kitchen/w/d/ We're all women, and due to the shared space we're looking for a housemate who is also, or non-binary or genderqueer. Your bathroom is shared (usually with just one housemate but she prefers to share her bathroom with another woman). (Please note that Fair Housing laws state that ""advertising which expresses a preference based upon sex is allowed in shared living situations where tenants will share a bathroom, kitchen, or other common area."" -- and in this case all of these are shared). We host occasional house concerts (about 2-4x per year). Starting date June 1st, yearly lease. If you're seeking a smaller, ground-floor room, there's a chance we might have an 8x8 ""garden room"" available September 1st for 695/mo (more info on that in a separate ad) There's a possibility that a little earlier might be possible too if needed. Artsy attic room is 795 mo. for lease through May or August 2018 (150/mo more if shorter), renewable yearly if it's a good fit for all. This rent includes storage space in your room, a small amount of kitchen space for your food/kitchen items, and plenty of bathroom space for toiletries, as well as yard space. But our living and dining room mostly contain our furniture, and aren't generally available for storage, which is why this room is more affordable than most. If you need extra space outside of your room, we could do some rearranging to make it happen, in which case the monthly rent would be a bit more (depending on how much extra space). Rent reduced to 695 with 3 hrs/mo of CMT (if you're a CMT with experience treating Myfascial TOS and ankle tendonitis). Sorry, the room is for just 1 person (in the unlikely event we consider 2, the rent would be $250 more, but we really prefer just one person). Please respond only if it all feels like truly a match for you (to help with that, the ad's so detailed it's practically a novel -- and please read it all before responding). Hardwood floors, bamboo eco-kitchen/laundry, back & front yard, trees! Attic ""Cloud room"", very private & secluded, feels kind of like a tree house, ~120 sq. ft including built-in loft bed platform, furnished with bed, built in shelves & desk, white & sky-blue with clouds, 2 windows overlooking the back yard Your bathroom (shared usually with 1 other, and with guests) has blue & white tile shower + bathtub, glass blocks, earthy-green-porcelain tile floor, large mahogany countertop, lots of cabinet space, 1 window etc. Own phone line available in the room PGE & EBMUD utilities shared Rent includes garbage service Extra plus for those who love nature: not only would you enjoy this awesome house in Berkeley, but also while renting here you'd get a discount stays at the Clear Air Mountain House, a fragrance-free LGBT-friendly retreat space in the Sierras, near the Yuba River, waterfalls, Pacific Crest Trail, Sierra Hot Springs, and over 45 lakes! That includes discounted work-trade stays too (just 2 hrs per night's lodging). We go there often and sometimes carpool from Berkeley. You: queer-friendly nonsmoking woman or genderqueer or non-binary person, honest, clean and responsible, considerate, respectful of quiet hours when others are sleeping, friendly, not a heavy partier, and enjoy women singer/songwriter music (we all volunteer to help the house concerts happen, so our first choice would be a housemate who's enthusiastic about the concerts and would like to be involved behind the scenes a few times a year). No musical ability is required at all to live here, but enthusiasm's a plus :o) We're looking for a housemate who is a mature (in behavior) adult, with honesty, integrity, and good communication skills. Us: All of the above. 45 y.o. Singer/Songwriter/Counselor, and 28 y.o. dancer and child development worker, and a 50 y.o environmental science student/gardener. Also, part-time housemates include: A 41 y.o. self-identified tech geek who lives at the house approximately half-time (sometimes less, sometimes more) and a 50-y.o. electrician who mostly lives in the South Bay but stays with us an average of a few days a month. We're a multicultural house and we all love music and nature. We're busy but friendly (greet each other, sometimes have conversations and spontaneous socializing, but with it's also a space where friendly introverts can have space). One of us has severe allergies to all tobacco & pot smoke (even if you smoke outdoors it would affect me), smoke residue (which means no one can enter the house within 24 hours of smoking anything at all), perfume, incense, patchouli, lavender-essential-oil (& many other flowery essential oils), scented hair-oil/leave-on-conditioner, hairspray, fabric softener residue, chemicals, etc., so please be a nonsmoker who doesn't wear fragrances (it's sad to be allergic to one's housemate -- so this one's not negotiable -- so if you wear perfume /fragrances or smoke even occasionally, even outdoors, or would be visited inside the house by those that do -- it wouldn't be a fit). Please share in your response how this fragrance-free policy fits with your own lifestyle. It's a beautiful craftsman house (not an apartment)! The spacious living/dining room is where volunteer-run volunteer-hosted women's house concerts take place about once every few months. Hardwood floors, mahogany wood paneling, beautiful art on the walls & an upright piano too! Environmentally friendly large newish eco-kitchen (bamboo cabinets by Alter-Eco, bamboo-floor, granite countertops), eco-washer/dryer, energy star range/stove/hood, dishwasher, and a cool reverse-osmosis-water-filter! 2 bathrooms, front vegetable/herb garden & back yard -- we have a peach tree and beautiful purple flowering vine, trees, a hammock, & more space to garden. We also have a stationary cycle for exercising indoors on rainy days. We're in North Berkeley, a very nice tree-lined area of Berkeley right near public transit, less than a mile from No. Berkeley BART, 1 mile from UC, & 3 miles from Tilden Park with hiking, lake swimming. Close to shops, restaurants, ""gourmet ghetto,"" Live Oak Park, etc.. Nature and convenience! A few steps from FatApple's restaurant. Sorry, no furry pets due to allergies. More about Rose Street's occasional concerts: Rose Street House of Music is a volunteer-run volunteer-hosted house concert & grassroots musical community featuring women singer-songwriters. Rose Street brings out women's voices through poetic music of substance and depth. All genders are welcome as audience, volunteers, and back-up musicians for the artists we feature. We realize this is way more specific than many houses, but we want to share the roommate compatibility info upfront to save everyone time. If this all is a great fit for you, please email for more info. If it's not a good fit, we ask that you please choose other places, because it's important to us that everyone be happy living here. We tend to receive a lot of responses based on price/location alone, so we're sorry but we won't be responding to generic inquiries. If you respond, please let us know why you feel this house is a good fit (besides the price and location). Please state ""Rose Street home"" in the subject (so we know the response is from a person and not a spam-bot :o) Also, please let us know the best email to send you more information about the room and us.

Location: 14th Ave. near Highland Hospital. When: May 24, possibly sooner. The house: 3 bedroom 2 bath. Single story. 6 steps up the stoop to the front door. Quiet, spacious house with productive garden, ducks, fire pit, compact driveway parking. Tidy indoor (and recently modernized), rustic outdoor (not at much in aesthetic, but in reality). One of us bikes to all flat-ish parts of oakland regularly, and with general ease. Pretty peachy for car bound people too. Current inhabitants: We are the master tenants: a couple and a kitty, we are very familial and spend a lot of time together- this house is very much our home. We like to share food, and hang out with our roommate too. Cat: 9uufdznkvadss;hi si dijdf;nk; wylhiudfnjv ds3evctnbi. . ....l8uo7y8999997oilllllll/ (tried typing her own bio). kitty is sweet, soooo friendly (the more you give the more you get) has an outdoor litter box so no stink. She will not tolerate any more furry animals (non-human), sorry. :-/ T: mid thirties white man, working class, into horticulture/permaculture, omnivory, baseball, and further than left (anti)politics. I like to fix things, solve problems, be creative, play games and live frugally. K: mid 30's mixed race cis-woman, anti so much stuff, pro cats, talking about mental health, being creative, being goofy, cooking yummy food. I'm very much a homebody and I'm super grateful to be living in this house with my sweetie and my kitty. The room: 10' X 11' room with 8' ceiling, right off the kitchen and one of the bathrooms. There is a 4' X 2' closet of similar height, and 2 windows facing the side of the house walkway and neighbors' house. Nice dark hardwood floor. Who we're looking for: ONE person, to live here and take care of the space. Cis-men are extremely deprioritized. Someone who lives in Oakland, wants to be in Oakland, and needs to keep living in Oakland. Know where you are; gunshots, break-ins, muggings are everyday occurrences in Oakland. Someone who is experienced with communal living AND has had positive experiences. You are: responsible, accountable, communicative, self motivated, proactive, engaging, mature. sex positive, queer positive, trans friendly someone with good boundaries willing to meet as a house at least monthly willing to deep clean the house as often as quarterly willing and self motivated to keep the common spaces clean and tidy, and take care of household items. Willing to the best of their ability to provide basic animal care and keep a safe living space for our critters. Does not have constant out of town guests. Regular visitors (that would do a lot of living here) should be considered, communicated, and consented. We are looking for a long term housemate in what may not be a perfectly stable situation. The housing market is hostile and this house could get sold or experience prohibitive rent increases. We expect that you'd be familiar with and critical of the changing demographics and markets of oakland. We prefer housemates that do not frequent gentrifying businesses, or at least feel awkward when they do. Also, FTP. If you use police services, do not apply. We enjoy our space quiet, please be quiet yourself, and know how to walk around the house quietly, close doors quietly, etc. We like things a certain way, and while we are flexible and interested in other people's ideas and suggestions, for the most part, we have things set up how we like them and want someone who can respect that and go with the flow. Also, since we are looking for a long term roommate that fits, the first 6 months will be like a sublet. During this trial we expect to stay in communication about how it is or isn't working out for all/each of us. Even within the 6 month trial, if it is CLEAR that it is not working out for ANY of us, we won't hesitate to ask you to move out with a 2 month notice. We also ask for a 2 month notice to vacate at any point that you decide to go. We feel that 6 months is a good amount of time to know whether we have a fit, and we are transparent about that so that you have a time framework for securing your own housing. Of course, this trial is just as much for you as it is for us. We are not so much looking to ""approve"" of our new housemate, but that we want our new housemate to TRY to be a part of this household. That said, we are really into talking things out and working out problems. Indeed it is the only way to have a healthy working household. We know this may seem like a lot to ask, but the right housemate will be up for it. We want your friendship and community. Join in getting by as we creatively enjoy ourselves and survive. Meow! Thanks. PS: We expect to get a lot of responses, we are well aware that this place is under market, but we really are looking for people that would be a good fit. So respond with something that actually says something about yourself, and that you understand and agree with the contents of this posting. So that we know you read our ad, please make ""cat house"" your subject line. If you ask ""is it still available"" without writing anything about yourself, we will not respond.

Awesome room in awesome place with awesome roommates. If you're into that sort of thing, please read this overly detailed description!

It is like a 10 minute walk, .6 miles. -Across the street from the F Transbay bus which takes you either to Berkeley campus or straight into San Francisco. -Within a half-mile there is a Safeway, coffee shops, Arizmandi bakery, delicious Ethiopian food, and other stuff.

He likes biking and active nonsense. -She is not into any of those things. She likes photography, astronomy, wandering around, and spending a lot of free time working or telling ridiculous stories about students. -We knew each other before we moved in together, so we hand out in the living room or cook dinner together at least twice a week.

We are currently looking for the right person to join our household. As of May 1st, we will have available for rent, a small-medium sized bedroom, (105sq.ft.) in our very nice 3 bedroom/2 bathroom house. The room is quaint, has two windows, and a large closet, and has been an ideal space for native and foreign college students/post grads, as well as others. The rent is $1025 per month, {not including utilities, (PG&E, EBMUD, and AT&T Wireless) which we share and split evenly among the housemates; averaging approximately another $100/month}. Our preference is a six month to year commitment, but may be willing to accept a shorter tenancy. First, Last and Deposit are required upon move in. The house is centrally located in Berkeley, and is within walking/biking distance to the UC. The house is small, homey, very charming and sunny, and has hardwood floors throughout. The neighborhood is safe and clean and primarily consists of single family homes. Our neighbors are all very friendly and considerate, and tend to keep an eye out for one another. Our house is also close to both the Downtown Berkeley and Ashby BART stations, and freeway access is just over a mile away. Several yummy restaurabnts are also just a few blocks away. Free street parking throughout the neighborhood is also readily available. The house is shared with a native, mellow Berkeley elementary school teacher, (and his two kids; half-time) whom have lived in the house 4.5 years, and two Italian Graduate Students. Together, we are looking to share our home with a clean, relatively quiet, respectful, friendly, and honest tenant, who likes kids. We intend on finding someone who understands and respects the fact that the household is shared, and who can agree to live by our common and basic house rules and standards. Our kitchen is spacious and sunny, and has a beautiful old Wedgewood gas range. You would be sharing a bathroom with the students, as the other tenant and his children, have their own. We are also a cat friendly household. If you're interested in arranging a time visit, I have availability to show our place by appointment this weekend or next week if need be.

Hardwood floors. Optionally comes furnished, including queen bed and dresser. The room gets lovely light throughout the day. $1,560/month plus utilities. LOCATION: Ideally located for walking to downtown and north Shattuck coffee shops, gourmet ghetto restaurants, retail, etc. 3.5 blocks to Trader Joe's.

Safe, friendly and extremely walkable quiet residential neighborhood, with permitted street parking. The property borders Ohlone Park on the back side. THE HOUSE: Top 2 floors of a 3-story Victorian house split into two units, filled with sunlight from unobstructed southern exposure. 3 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, plus a living room with gas fireplace heater, big kitchen plus dining area.

We share meals a few times a week (or at least take turns cooking for one another depending on what busy lives allow). We enjoy hosting occasional gatherings, sharing food, thoughtful discussion, music, skills, book club, etc. -- definitely more on the intimate than the raucous side of things. We value beauty and relaxed cleanliness in the home, sharing the responsibilities for cleaning and tidying our shared spaces. HOUSEMATES: Daniel: I'm a 38 year-old male and Bay Area native. I lived in large co-op houses for 10 years and now love our small, peaceful household with a cooperative spirit.

I enjoy gathering friends for thoughtful discussion, music-making, and stories. I'm a folk singer-songwriter, community builder, educator, and freelance anthropologist working in design/technology. I'm passionate about lifelong learning and personal growth, Buddhist meditation, photography, and wilderness. Sarah: I'm a 34 year old female. I'm passionate about healing and work as a psychotherapist. I'm a Buddhist meditator, love to dance, be silly with friends, be in nature, and make art. I'm looking forward to sharing a sweet home space - a place for prayer, realness, music, great connection and gatherings, and peace. ",37.873786,-122.275407

Available now. Optionally comes fully furnished, including queen bed. Open to any gender, financially stable, who shares a similar vision to what we describe below. About the Place: THE BEDROOM: Master bedroom (10' x 15') with huge panoramic window plus two smaller rooms (8' x 5' and 6.5' x 6.5') for walk-in closet or secondary office/sitting space, each with a window. Hardwood floors. Optionally comes furnished, including queen bed and dresser. The room gets lovely light throughout the day. $1,560/month plus utilities. LOCATION: Ideally located for walking to downtown and north Shattuck coffee shops, gourmet ghetto restaurants, retail, etc. 3.5 blocks to Trader Joe's. Less than a mile to Monterey Market, Andronico's, Safeway, Local Butcher, and Thursday farmer's market. 10 minute walk to either downtown BART or North Berkeley BART. Safe, friendly and extremely walkable quiet residential neighborhood, with permitted street parking. The property borders Ohlone Park on the back side. THE HOUSE: Top 2 floors of a 3-story Victorian house split into two units, filled with sunlight from unobstructed southern exposure. 3 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, plus a living room with gas fireplace heater, big kitchen plus dining area. The house has beautiful design details that make it feel very special. Washer/dryer inside. House cleaning once/month. Huge 2nd story outdoor sun deck overlooking Ohlone Park, backyard.

Ideally you are interested in a year+ assuming everything is going well. HOUSE CULTURE: Our house culture is a warm, inviting space where there is a balance between connection and spaciousness among us. We value groundedness, honesty and integrity, emotional intelligence, kindness, open mindedness, and strong communication skills. We share meals a few times a week (or at least take turns cooking for one another depending on what busy lives allow). We enjoy hosting occasional gatherings, sharing food, thoughtful discussion, music, skills, book club, etc. -- definitely more on the intimate than the raucous side of things. We value beauty and relaxed cleanliness in the home, sharing the responsibilities for cleaning and tidying our shared spaces. HOUSEMATES: Daniel: I'm a 38 year-old male and Bay Area native. I lived in large co-op houses for 10 years and now love our small, peaceful household with a cooperative spirit. Home for me is a sanctuary, a place to be real through all the emotional colors of life, a place of quiet refuge, friendship and good food. I enjoy gathering friends for thoughtful discussion, music-making, and stories. I'm a folk singer-songwriter, community builder, educator, and freelance anthropologist working in design/technology. I'm passionate about lifelong learning and personal growth, Buddhist meditation, photography, and wilderness. Sarah: I'm a 34 year old female. I'm passionate about healing and work as a psychotherapist. I'm a Buddhist meditator, love to dance, be silly with friends, be in nature, and make art. I'm looking forward to sharing a sweet home space - a place for prayer, realness, music, great connection and gatherings, and peace. ",37.873786,-122.275407

We are hoping to find several mature and mindful roommates who are interested in sharing this space with us. The home is fully furnished except for the soon to be empty rooms, as we have been here for a couple of years already. It is a ~15 minute walk from campus just off of Parker and Regent in South Berkeley. We have a large yard and deck that is a perfect space for entertaining friends and family or just hanging out to enjoy the weather. If growing your own food is of interest to you, we have that also! Over the last couple of years an organic garden has been established that you are welcome to contribute to and plant your own veggies/herbs. Our neighborhood is nice, relatively quiet at night, and has many good eats within walking distance. We are also just down the street from Willard Park, which is beautiful on a sunny day. Also, our landlord is awesome! He usually responds to any requests within the day and has always followed through with any maintenance requests or other questions. The rent listed does not including utilities (which run ~50/person/month with 4 people). The main room available upstairs is quite big and perfect for someone who wants plenty of space, or for a couple to live in. We have the option of having a fifth room available since both the living room and dining room close off completely and either can be converted into a private room. We are open to this option, which would also depend on the preference of any incoming tenants. If you are interested, please send along an email (my name is Aaron) with a short bit about why you think you would be a good fit.

The suite is approximately 400 s.f., with carpeted floors, large south facing windows, a private toilet room with shower and direct access to the entry courtyard. Rent is $1200 per month plus approximately $100/per person/per month for utilities, with a $1200 security deposit. Move-in will require a 6-month lease. Leases rollover to a month-to-month lease after 6 months. Utilities are shared and include water, garbage, PG&E, internet, and a monthly visit from a housecleaning agency. There is no on-site parking, no pets, no subletting, and no smoking indoors. The Muse is conveniently located 2 blocks from the Berkeley border on Shattuck Avenue, 4 blocks from Ashby BART, 1.2 miles from U.C. Berkeley, walking distance to the Berkeley Bowl, and across the street from the Nomad Café. The #18 bus runs right down Shattuck Ave., and several other buses are very close by. The one-story, Hacienda-style arrangement of the Muse promotes a cozy community feeling, and offers a variety of outdoor seating and gathering areas directly off of living spaces. There's a spacious common kitchen with a 6-burner gas stove, a great garden where we grow vegetables and flowers, a bbq area, an open guest room for occasional visitors, and on-site coin-op laundry facilities. ABOUT THE HOUSEMATES: The Muse is a wonderful group house comprised of 15 creative individuals and couples, plus 2 small children. Housemates range in age from 24 to 41 years old. We include: teachers, gardeners, dancers, artists, actors, journalists, organizers, and people with various other jobs/hobbies/interests. We support each other's causes and collaborate on creative projects. AROUND THE HOUSE: Although we cooperate, we are not a co-op. Every person is responsible for themselves, but we share the cost of a few basic household expenses (and house dinners - see below). We are all pretty laid back, respectful of each other's personal space, and aspire to a high standard of cleanliness in shared spaces. If you are not prepared to consistently do your dishes after you are done cooking/eating, please do not apply. We all have basic daily or weekly chores, and hold one monthly house meeting which all must attend. We also have a tradition of house dinners where, for $24/person per week, a team of housemates cooks dinner for the entire house four weeknights. (In other words - for 24 bucks, you help cook once a week, you eat 4x/week) There is no obligation to be there at a certain time to eat, although many of us often do eat together, and if you're going to be out of town, you simply let others know and you don't have to pay for that night(s). This is not a requirement, but our preference is for everyone to be a part of this tradition. We are seeking housemates who will not see this as renting a room in an apartment or boarding house. We are specifically looking for community-minded people who are motivated, outgoing and friendly; not afraid to share opinions; respectful of others, and willing to contribute to household tasks. People of all backgrounds and identities are welcome. Although the lease is only 6-months (and month-to-month after that), we are seeking roommates with an intention to invest themselves in the community and make it their home for a longer period of time. All cooking equipment is shared, and meat-friendly. Those with chemical and odor sensitivities won't be comfortable here. Sorry, no Skype interviews - we'd like to meet applicants in person. And no pets (no exceptions). If you are interested, please reply with the following: 1) Name, phone number, email 2) Profession/passion 3) Why are you are leaving your place? 4) Why do you want to live in a group house/how would you see yourself participating in community? 5) Do you have philosophies on/experiences with group living? 6) What do you like to do in your free time? 7) Would you rather go to the moon for a week, or live in another country for a year? Why? 8) When would you like to move in? 9) Your age and gender 10) Anything else you'd like us to know about you? 11) Favorite song? Thanks for your interest! ",37.851026,-122.26648

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/roo/6098302097.html,Room in a great four-bedroom house in Berkeley (Elmwood),850.0,berkeley,2017-05-15,120,"['w/d in unit', 'no smoking', 'off-street parking', 'no private bath', 'private room']"," Hi- We are looking for a housemate to join us in our beautiful, four-bedroom house in the Elmwood neighborhood of Berkeley. The room is available starting May 15, with some flexibility in either direction. The rent is $850, and the room is about 12x10ft with a small closet. There are three of us in the house currently. We all lead busy lives outside the house, but we enjoy being part of a shared home as well - bumping into each other in the kitchen, the occasional shared meal, philosophical discussion, movies, etc. We are looking for a mature, friendly, responsible fourth person to join us, ideally somebody who is looking for the same. ABOUT THE PLACE The layout of the house is pretty perfect for a shared house - all four bedrooms are on the second story, with all the shared living space on the first story (no right-off-the-kitchen bedrooms). The room for rent is quiet (not situated over any common space) and is south facing with a couple of windows and plenty of light The house is spacious at two stories and 1750 sq ft with 2 full baths and off street parking; a large kitchen with dishwasher, double oven, gas range & washer/dryer. We're on a bike boulevard (quiet street); we have a nice outdoor grill, a large backyard with dedicated veggie patch (currently between plantings), and a deck. We don't do standard TV, but we do have an awesome home theater setup with HD projector, a fireplace, and a front room that can double as dining / guest room. THE NEIGHBORHOOD We are situated about a half mile south of campus near Ashby and Telegraph. Most everything you need is close by. Walking distance to UC Berkeley (15 mins), Whole Foods (2 blocks), Berkeley Bowl (4 blocks), Ashby BART (6 blocks) and all of the happenings on Telegraph, College, and Shattuck. THE EXTRAS Utilities, high-speed Internet, Netflix, shared house items like toilet paper and dish soap, and twice monthly professional house cleaning (no chore wheels!) total around $150/month per person. ABOUT US We are three friendly and thoughtful science-y types, two post-docs and one consultant. We're responsible, social, and mature, and are looking for somebody for whom that sounds like a good match. We all like living in a shared house and have lived in similar situations in the past, so are pretty respectful and easy to get along with.. A little more about each of us : Grant recently moved here from Colorado and is working at LBL on water filtration research. He's also in the process of fixing up a couple of awesome, classic BMW motorcycles that have lived, apparently unused, in our shed for decades. He is also a super enthusiastic ultimate player. Mark has been in Berkeley the longest, and is an scientist / consultant by day, working for a variety of greentech-y companies around the Bay Area. He is also in his spare time working on a crazy app to replace the old organizer / calendar phone apps with something that helps us figure out how to live in better alignment with what we really value and love. He loves to brainstorm ideas on it - ask him about it! Cedric is a post-doc from Switzerland on the main UC campus working in organic chemistry, making molecules that, amongst other things, could be useful to medical research one day.. In addition to being a smart and nice guy, he's an amateur photographer (we have some of his work hanging up in the house) and has backpacked and travelled recently to a number of pretty awesome places that make the rest of us jealous. We all are pretty busy with stuff outside the house, but we like the laid back, warm, welcoming vibe that comes from living in a shared house where people enjoy interacting with each other. We are looking for somebody who is looking for not just a house to sleep in, but a home to live in. THE DEAL If you think this is the place for you, please send us an email with a bit about yourself: 1. Who are you and what do you do for work and for fun? 2. What are you looking for in a living space? 3. What has worked great in living situations in the past for you? 4. Optional: if you could choose to be amazingly good at one thing.. what would it be? :) Thanks for reading, and good luck in your search! -Mark, Grant, Cedric ",37.857726,-122.26018

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/roo/6107752532.html,AVOID RENTING A ROOM FROM TONI HOGAN-Will breach contract.,,fairfield / vacaville,,,"['no private bath', 'room not private']"," I'm going to help others out there looking for a room to rent so that this doesn't happen to another person after my experience living with the landlord. Please know your tenant rights and understand your contract with the landlord and ask if there are rules that he or she is expecting before signing off contracts. Toni Hogan's home was built in the 1950's with no air vents in the bedroom, but just in the common room and the kitchen. A week after I moved in, the outlets in the bedroom I rented blew out and I addressed these issues to her; washer and dryer broke and those were also addressed. Eventually she is going to need to replace her 20 year old water heater because that's also about to break. I wouldn't doubt it if she just bought a refurbished water heater. Being that it was summer, I was preparing for the upcoming winter season, wanting to make sure my outlets get fixed. Toni couldn't afford it and she suggested I open the bedroom door to get heat from the hallway heater. Rules kept changing along the way, right up through February. It was so cold like a meat locker that it got as cold as 57-61 degrees and she would only allow the heater to run for 5 minutes. Pictures and videos to prove of her physically shutting off the heater after 5 minutes. My contract was written ""rent with utilities"", which I paid every month and on time. She wanted to raise the rent by 10% to cover the cost of utilities, which made no sense if NONE of my wall outlets are NOT in working condition. So if you have a phone, laptop, a portable heater, etc, you couldn't charge it unless you take it to the kitchen. I decided to exercise my tenant rights, which she made it impossible for me to live in, she tried to intimidate me, and removed the thermostat so I couldn't get heat at all. I thought this was someone who I thought I would get along with. She was very passive aggressive towards me when her child was around. She did a self-eviction even though I was trying to move out in a quiet fashion, which by the way the 3-days to vacate was defective. Her updated contracts were so inconsistent. I had to call the cops to make sure I will be safe to collect the rest of my belongings. FYI: ""Self eviction"" is illegal and that a landlord must go through the process to file with the courts. I consulted with my attorney and threatened the landlord, Toni with a lawsuit for theft, backpay on rent for non-working outlets, and for sue her for each day she locked me out, among other things, which I have a plethora of proven photos and live videos. I made sure I collected evidence before leaving that unsafe and outdated home. I am pretty sure she will try to find a way to do a temporary fix or ""temporary band-aid"" instead of doing the right thing by getting things fixed around the house like a landlord should do when he/she has a tenant. However, who knows how long anything in that house will last. Her dishwasher broke and she would rather fix that before fixing the washer/dryer and not prioritize when she has tenants. For someone who says they can't afford to fix appliances or maintain the upkeep around the home, she sure can afford to get pedicures and gel manicures. So avoid renting from her or you'll just end up in a war zone with her. BEWARE: None of her ELECTRIC WIRING is NOT grounded, which is a potential fire hazard. I remembered there was a month when I had recently paid rent, only to find out a few days later that our water got shut off. I took a screenshot of the water notice that was outside the door when I arrived home and sent it to her. ",38.2671,-122.0357

Fully furnished and ready for relaxation. Tucked away in the deep valley between Castro Valley and Pleasanton, carriage house apartment is a gem."" Regards, David Recent Testimonial from Guest: Here is a letter about my experience: Living on Palomares Road was a great experience. The location was perfect as it felt like country living although it was only minutes from everything. It was really nice to come home from work and look into the green mountains on one side and grass hills on the other. The scenery is beautiful and hearing all the different animals and nature is truly rare when living in the Bay Area. KJ's horses are another touch that make you feel like you are getting away from all the city commotion. Kathy Jo is a great landlord as she takes pride in all her belongings and what she provides to tenants. She is always there to make sure you are comfortable, have no problems, or need something to do. Thanks again for the hospitality. I really enjoyed living over there!

We need a new roommate for one of the three bedrooms in our apartment. The apartment is located in a safe, family neighborhood in the Gourmet Ghetto. It is within walking distance to many stores including CVS, Safeway, Walgreens, and many great restaurants. The building is small with about 8 units. We are almost exactly one mile from the North Berkeley and Berkeley BART stations. About the Apartment: Three bedrooms, one full bath, full kitchen, open living/dining area, balcony, lots of storage space One occupied bedroom shares a wall divider with living area Furnished; new furniture/appliances welcome (we're not fans of clutter though) Dishwasher On-site laundry ($2.00 per wash and $1.50 for 60 min drying time) Easy street parking Excellent natural light Wood floors throughout apt Other tenants in the building are friendly and respectful; leasing company is always nice and helpful Large balcony Newly finished bath tub/shower Outside storage unit Utilities (internet, electricity) are ~$60/person (divided 3 ways) 420 friendly Animal friendly About the Bedroom: It is the largest of the three Open and airy Spacious Walk-in closet Sink/vanity Large window The room will be available towards the end of May. Move-in date flexible. $700 deposit $1500/month Due when you move in $700 + first month's rent About Us: I'm 29 years old, female, originally from Virginia. I moved to Berkeley about three years ago. I graduated from Virginia Tech with a degree in biochemistry. I currently work in a high-volume spay/neuter clinic. I love my job! My interests include reading, animal welfare, rehabilitation, and conservation, and nerdy science stuff. I work full-time, usually Tuesday-Friday. I leave early and am home around 7 PM. I enjoy spending my free time out and about or just relaxing at the apartment. I have the room with the wall divider separating it from the living area. I am pretty chill about the noise level, as long as it remains reasonable. I am 27-year-old male, originally from New York City where I spent three years working in education policy prior to relocating to Berkeley last August. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at UC Berkeley studying issues of equity in higher education. As a student, I spend approximately 4-8 hours per day (typically between 9am-5pm) either in class or otherwise on campus working/studying. Depending on my course schedule, I spend some mornings/afternoons at home. Additionally, I tend to prefer working/studying in the apartment common spaces or in my room on most late afternoons/nights, sometimes going until the wee hours of the morning. There are times when I work outside the apartment--usually this depends on whether the common spaces are being utilized and my mood. In addition to graduate school, I participate in singing/theatre activities and have been known to belt out a couple notes and passionately recite a monologue. However, I am cognizant of others and tend to reserve any practicing for when everyone is out of the house. Occasionally, during the academic year I host friends for hangouts/study sessions, seldom do I host overnight guests. Overall, I am neat, sociable, extremely open, and a direct communicator. We are more about cooperation, open, direct communication, and finding middle ground, than setting strict rules. Our ideal new roommate would be a graduate student or young professional, tidy, with consistent work/school hours. If you think you would be a good fit, please email us through Craigslist. Please include your age, and some information about yourself. Thanks! :)1493352310 - 1973 ",37.883996,-122.273723

From David our Kaiser Executive Guest who has resided with us for many months while contracting his consulting to Kaiser in Pleasanton. My testimonial for use as you see fit: ""Tremendous setting that offers the best of both worlds...a country setting that is minutes from major employment settings in the East Bay area. Fully furnished and ready for relaxation. Tucked away in the deep valley between Castro Valley and Pleasanton, carriage house apartment is a gem."" Regards, David Recent Testimonial from Guest: Here is a letter about my experience: Living on Palomares Road was a great experience. The location was perfect as it felt like country living although it was only minutes from everything. It was really nice to come home from work and look into the green mountains on one side and grass hills on the other. The scenery is beautiful and hearing all the different animals and nature is truly rare when living in the Bay Area. KJ's horses are another touch that make you feel like you are getting away from all the city commotion. Kathy Jo is a great landlord as she takes pride in all her belongings and what she provides to tenants. She is always there to make sure you are comfortable, have no problems, or need something to do. Thanks again for the hospitality. I really enjoyed living over there! Sincerely, Andrew Nosa LOCATION SETTINGS: A bikers paradise ........ Only 5 minutes from town you are really in the "" country "" thus you could hear chickens or horse whinnies.

We are socially active, and, although we often spend evenings and weekends at friend houses or out of town, enjoy having friends over on a semi-regular basis and occasionally host a family member or two for a couple nights. If you are interested email us with a little information about yourself and we can set up a time to meet. We hope you will be able to commit to at least 6 months or longer. In the interest of space, we cannot take a couple and, in the interest of some roommates with some pretty tough pet allergies, we cannot accept pets either. We look forward to meeting you and good luck in your search! ",37.809527,-122.28428

It's extremely easy to get anywhere without driving but if you wanna drive it's easy and lots of free parking everywhere.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/roo/6094201905.html,Furnished room with private bath - 30 steps to BART!,700.0,richmond / point / annex,2017-05-10,110,"['furnished', 'w/d in unit', 'no smoking', 'street parking', 'private bath', 'private room']"," TL;DR: - Short-term (2-5 months) between 5/10 - 10/21. - Move in date is flexible, but must be able to visit/decide before 5/10. - Super easy access to BART that can get you around - Rent $700 + Utilities/internet (usually $50-80); Deposit: $500 - 1 room with private bath; furnished; laundry in house. - Vegetarian household (no meat/fish anywhere inside the house); - Not ideal if you have car; street parking with 2h limits 8am-6pm M-F Hello! I am looking for a lovely person (prefer female) that could rent my room with a private bath in a 3br/3bath town home while I am away on a trip. Oh yes- sadly that means we are not going to be housemates. Don't worry - the other housemates are wonderful. They are free thinkers while still respecting the culture and belief systems in this world. You will be living with one female and one couple. We are all conscious, respectful, quiet and clean adults. This could be ideal for a visiting researcher in UC Berkeley or someone new to the bay area getting started with their new job, or someone desiring a commuter room close to SF. This is for one bedroom (10x11) in a 3 bed/3 bath (1500 sq ft) in a vegetarian household. Your room is in 2nd floor towards the back of the house (right next to the kitchen?). The house has 3 floors. Your room comes with a bed, book shelf, sound system, and a closet. Linens will be provided if you need them. The room is available May 11, 2017. Move-in date is flexible, but the move-out date is Oct 21st 2017 - and is non-negotiable. Private bathroom with shower just outside the room. Single occupancy only. The rent is $700 per month plus your share of utilities. Ideally I am looking for someone that can stay 2-5 months, so please state your preference in your response. The deposit would be $500. Cost to move-in: First month + Last month + deposit. This townhome is right next to the Richmond BART (no kidding - it's 30 steps to the ticket counter) in downtown Richmond (near civic center) - you can commute to Berkeley in ~10 minutes, Oakland in ~20 minutes and SF in ~35 minutes. The proximity to BART makes this place quite safe. Nearest grocery store Food Co is 1.5 blocks away. For nature lovers, Marina Bay and Point Richmond are just 3 miles away. You are a short driving distance to nice regional parks, Keller beach and the historic Richmond plunge swimming pool. Washer and dryer are available in the house. Unfortunately, we already have two cars, so garage parking is not available - if you have a car, you would have to park it on the street which has 2 hour limit from 8am-6pm. If you don't have a car, you wouldn't need one as you will be so close to the BART. We help each other with occasional grocery errands. Please honor these house rules: * No meat (animals, birds, sea food) in the house (cooking/consumption/storage). Dairy and eggs are okay. You can consume whatever outside :) * No indoor smoking, vaping etc. * No pets. * Keep shared areas clean. If you're interested, please write about yourself (personal and work), why you need temporary housing, what you like about this place, how your income/savings can support the rent, what values are important to you and acknowledge/write about how you feel about the house rules and please provide your phone number. No generic emails please - at least customize one paragraph to this post. If you saw this post, be assured it's still available. You should be in the bay area to visit the place before 5/10 so we can decide mutually if this is the right fit - you can move in/move out anytime depending on how long you are planning to stay. This is not Richmond in SF - it's Richmond, CA - a city in East Bay. I don't think you will enjoy this space if you feel limited by your ability to bring/consume/store meat/poultry/aquatic food. I think this will be a perfect place if you are naturally driven towards adopting a vegetarian lifestyle. ",37.936828,-122.355155

We would also consider a couple since the bedroom, though not large, can certainly fit a queen size bed and some other furniture. The rent for a couple would be $1575. Our townhouse is on three levels and has beautiful light. We occupy the two bedrooms and two baths upstairs. The middle level is a modern kitchen and living area complete with fireplace and deck, and the downstairs has another bedroom and its own bathroom. That room, which would be yours, also has a private entry although all three levels are connected by a common entryway. We are close enough to the freeway for an easy commute and also are walking distance to the Emeryville Bart-Go-Round. There is plenty of street parking. We are not party people (and are drug-free) but our friends are welcome in our home. It's important to us to keep the common areas clean and neat. This means regularly cleaning up the kitchen after using it, keeping the common areas free of clutter, taking out garbage and recycling, etc. The house is furnished except for your bedroom, and we welcome your making the common areas more your own and more cozy for everyone. The rent has several perks: it includes all utilities plus excellent internet, netflix, hulu, and a once monthly professional cleaning of the common areas. The neighborhood is in the process of being gentrified so there is a mixture of very new buildings, refurbished Victorians, and older buildings. Several blocks away it is still down and out, but we have found our street and neighborhood to be very safe. ",37.8365,-122.2804

My name is Anushka and I share my house with my husband and 4 really nice housemates. We are an international and culturally diverse community. We currently have a large furnished room that is available May 15th. The bedroom is the only room on the 2nd floor (so very private). It has lots of light (7 windows!) and its own heating. The flooring is carpet. The room has a single bed, two shelving units, desk, chair, cabinet with shelves, and a closet just outside the main room. This room also comes with its own private 1/2 bath consisting of a sink and toilet. Rent for this bedroom is $1,200 per month (for one person). Deposit is $800. I am looking for someone who wants the room for at least 6 months. Wireless internet access (Xfinitiy by Comcast) and utilities are included in the rent, so there is no need for you to pay extra bills. My husband and I do the house chores such as cleaning common areas and taking out the compost/recycling/trash, so you don't really have to do anything except pick up after yourself and clean any dishes, pots, pans and utensils, counterspace you use. The house has two full bathrooms (one with a bathtub/shower, the other with a simple shower), and two half baths (sink and toilet). Shared spaces include the kitchen (including all pots and pans, dishes and cooking utensils), living room (with piano and TV-VCR-DVD player), basement (with washer, dryer, and space for bicycles), and garden (herbs, veggies, fruit trees, flowers, and plenty of space to relax). Location is great: 10 min bike ride to downtown Berkeley; 15 min walk to BART station (transit); bus stops 1/2 block away; San Pablo Park, with public tennis courts and basketball courts, 5 min walk; 5 min to freeway by car; the amazing grocery store ""Berkeley Bowl West"" is just 5 min by bike; 10 minute walk to some nice neighborhood cafes and restaurants. We love people from all over the world! No pets, please, and absolutely NO SMOKERS (not even if you smoke outside the home!). And no ""ex""-smokers who ""just quit"", or smokers who think they 'will quit' when they move in, either (sorry to have to mention this, but we have unfortunately had bad experiences with such people in the past). We are a very international community and really love connecting with other cultures. Give me a call if you are interested, and if I don't answer, please leave me a voicemail telling me a bit about yourself. If you are outside of the US, you can call me via WhatsApp (Anushka Drescher - phone number as stated in this ad).

Text or email is best. Happy room hunting, hope to hear from you!*** We have a downstairs room becoming available for rent either on May 1st in our gorgeous two story 1,600 sq ft home in Albany. We are on a one year lease to be renewed Sept 1st - our landlord is awesome and wants us to live here for many years if possible so yay for stable and long term! Quick facts: We are only looking to add one person meaning no couples and most likely no pets (we already have 1 younger female cat - maybe one more female could work if they get along? Landlord has been explicit about no dogs though). No Trump fans either please :) A bit about the house: 4 bedrooms, 2 full bathrooms (meaning two showers), living room, new kitchen/eating area, backyard, and a giant basement/garage that acts as a second living room, jam space, and storage area. Washer and dryer. Newly renovated last year by our landlord who is a super cool guy that lives in Richmond and raised his family in the house. The house is on Evelyn and Garfield, a 10 min walk to BART, 5 min walk to Trader Joe's, blocks away from Solano Ave and San Pablo. No less than 5 bars within short walking distance. Tons of shops and everything you need. One block away from the Ohlone Greenway, which is an awesome bike/walking trail. If you're unfamiliar with Albany, it's worth getting to know. A tiny town between Berkeley and El Cerrito, full of dogs and kids and friendly folk. The whole town is less than 2 square miles and was founded in the early 1900's when a group of local women protested Berkeley dumping their garbage in the area with shotguns (whoa!). Now though, it is safe to walk the neighborhood all hours of the night, which is rare for the bay area. The room for rent is 12x14 and has a closet. It is a downstairs bedroom so there is a little noise from the bedroom upstairs. No more than expected but feel free to test it out when you check out the place. A bit about the roomies: Brian G, 32, has worked in the non-profit world and solar and currently is taking a break. A longtime vegan who won't bug you about cooking meat but will definitely ask you to try the awesome food he makes. Lover of beer and his ukulele. Brian K, 26, is getting his masters to become a teacher and is currently working as an aide in a school in SF. Lover of volleyball, Gilmore Girls, and cooking Korean food. Hamza S, 29, works in tech sales in SF. Has a really nice fiancé that comes around sometimes to hangout. Is the caretaker of Bo. Passionate about sustainable entrepreneurship and will happily talk to you about A.I. Bo is a cat. She is cute and soft and kind of nervous/skittish. A bit about you: Steadily employed and decent credit with solid references (you will need to provide paystub/bank statement to our landlord and fill out an application). Does dishes within the day (or two). Down to help keep common areas tidy (we are using a cleaning service monthly though). Also willing to wear house slippers, hah. Interesting and chill with your own life but also down to hang out and be friendly in the house; we are all very independent but dig living together. Direct and clear communicator. Lover/appreciator of music. Passive aggressive? No thanks! Hope it goes without saying since this is the bay area, but this is a hate-free zone. Our home will always be open to gay, trans and POC. We have diverse backgrounds and values; Muslim, atheist, vegan, omnivore, gay, straight. That being said we hella joke and try to be cognizant of when words obviously do not come from a place of malice. Rent is $1,250 + utilities (PGE, EBMUD, wifi, house cleaning - roughly $100 a person a month - a bit more in the ""winter"" but not much). Move in cost is first and last month plus ¼ of the security deposit which is $4,500 total. So $3,625 total. ***We will be holding interviews this Saturday April 29 between 11am and 5pm by appointment. Text or email is best.

Our townhouse is on three levels and has beautiful light. We occupy the two bedrooms and two baths upstairs. The middle level is a modern kitchen and living area complete with fireplace and deck, and the downstairs has another bedroom and its own bathroom.

We are not party people (and are drug-free) but our friends are welcome in our home. It's important to us to keep the common areas clean and neat. This means regularly cleaning up the kitchen after using it, keeping the common areas free of clutter, taking out garbage and recycling, etc. The house is furnished except for your bedroom, and we welcome your making the common areas more your own and more cozy for everyone. The rent has several perks: it includes all utilities plus excellent internet, netflix, hulu, and a once monthly professional cleaning of the common areas.

The apartment is newly renovated and has all the upgrades you could dream of (including a private deck with beautiful views of all 3 bridges!). Move in would be anytime between May 20th. This would be a month-to-month sublease. Also, the tenants are responsible for paying the gas, electric, water, internet bills, which will be split equally, are not included in the price above. Deposit is $1250. Dogs are welcome, but I need to be ensured that there won't be excessive noise/barking during the day. The place has a dining room (with fireplace), living room, breakfast nook, private deck that faces the water, new appliances, garage, (3) designated parking spots (inside the garage, in front of the garage (right-most one in the pic), and in the back (where my yellow car is)), shared patio with BBQ, shared garden area, shared window-nook hangout room facing the water, and free shared laundry. There is also a beach at the end of our street that is walkable (~10 min walk). Please see the pictures above to get an idea of what the place looks like. The place is furnished except for your bedroom. However, if you have nicer furniture, I can move my stuff to the garage for storage. A little more about me. . . I'm originally from Chicago and got my Mechanical Engineering degree from Purdue. I graduated in 2013 and took a few months off before starting my job with the Chevron site down the street as a Designs Engineer. I've lived my first couple years in SF but eventually got tired of the long commute, over-cramped and under-sized apartments with insanely high rent. Once I realized the best-kept secret at the Point, I decided to move to save time and money and get 'more bang for my buck'. BART is only a 10 minute ride away if I ever do want to do into the city though, which is nice to keep the option open. Although I'm an engineer, I don't fit the typical stereotype; I love talking with people and making new friends. I'm always looking to grab dinner and a beer with friends or have people over for game or movie night. Since I work long hours, I'm usually pretty chill on the weekdays and just like to just relax by watching TV. On the weekends, I usually am out and about doing something or another. I'm also very into tennis, frisbee, and softball. I also love board games, rock climbing, and am a rudimentary sailor. If you're interested and would like to set up a time to meet me & view the apartment, please answer the following questions: 1. Move In Date 2. What furniture you have 3. Facebook and/or LinkedIn 4. Do you have a pet? If so, what type? 5. Short description of who you are / what you are looking for ",37.929724,-122.392482

The second story has a balcony that allows lots of light and views of the street.

I don't entertain at home very often. I'm laidback and very good about communicating with roommates. If you like things neat and clean and know how to clean up after yourself, we'll both be happy! I'm looking for a pet free and non-smoking roommate. When I advertise this room, I typically get many replies. The ones I reply to usually share a few paragraphs about who you are, what you are like to live with, your hobbies, and maybe a link to your social media profiles.

The two women you would be sharing the house with are social justice oriented women who work in public health positions in San Francisco. We host meetings occasionally at our house, and have a welcoming vibe. At the same time, we hold full-time jobs so usually spend the evenings pretty quietly and do our own thing. QTPOC encouraged to apply. The house is kept clean by all housemates (using a monthly chore chart), and we are relaxed but responsible about this and expect the same level of cleanliness from our next roommate. We could welcome a dog, pets are a case-by-case basis (up to the landlord). We have a very friendly small dog that lives with us part-time. There is no smoking inside the house, and keep a no shoe rule in the house. Our landlord will want a security deposit (1 month's rent) and will need proof of employment and will run a SmartMove credit check. There's a small fee associated with it which the landlord will refund if you pass and sign the lease. The room is open starting on June 1st, with some flexibility to start moving in before then.

The kitchen and shared spaces are furnished, but there is room to incorporate your furnishings too. Bedroom is unfurnished. Washer and dryer are located in the flat.

Apartment will be unfurnished, however I do have almost an entire kitchen setup and place settings for 6 with enough cups for days. I also plan on investing in a couch upon move-in. However your room and other items in the common area will not be furnished. There is a washer and dryer in unit.

Another cat would be fine, but he's never been around dogs so as much as I love them, I will have to say no dogs. Also, if you're allergic to cats, this probably isn't the apartment for you. Move-in would be June 6th but I'm posting now to try a find someone before the lease starts officially so that I don't have to pay all the fees myself upfront lol. Pictures uploaded will be of unit currently available for move in and exact replica of unit I'm renting. I do want to meet up and get to know someone before a lease is signed so feel free to shoot me an email and we can try to get together.

Move-in date flexible. $700 deposit $1500/month Due when you move in $700 + first month's rent About Us: I'm 29 years old, female, originally from Virginia. I moved to Berkeley about three years ago. I graduated from Virginia Tech with a degree in biochemistry. I currently work in a high-volume spay/neuter clinic. I love my job! My interests include reading, animal welfare, rehabilitation, and conservation, and nerdy science stuff. I work full-time, usually Tuesday-Friday. I leave early and am home around 7 PM. I enjoy spending my free time out and about or just relaxing at the apartment. I have the room with the wall divider separating it from the living area. I am pretty chill about the noise level, as long as it remains reasonable. I am 27-year-old male, originally from New York City where I spent three years working in education policy prior to relocating to Berkeley last August. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at UC Berkeley studying issues of equity in higher education. As a student, I spend approximately 4-8 hours per day (typically between 9am-5pm) either in class or otherwise on campus working/studying. Depending on my course schedule, I spend some mornings/afternoons at home. Additionally, I tend to prefer working/studying in the apartment common spaces or in my room on most late afternoons/nights, sometimes going until the wee hours of the morning. There are times when I work outside the apartment--usually this depends on whether the common spaces are being utilized and my mood. In addition to graduate school, I participate in singing/theatre activities and have been known to belt out a couple notes and passionately recite a monologue. However, I am cognizant of others and tend to reserve any practicing for when everyone is out of the house. Occasionally, during the academic year I host friends for hangouts/study sessions, seldom do I host overnight guests. Overall, I am neat, sociable, extremely open, and a direct communicator. We are more about cooperation, open, direct communication, and finding middle ground, than setting strict rules. Our ideal new roommate would be a graduate student or young professional, tidy, with consistent work/school hours. If you think you would be a good fit, please email us through Craigslist.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/roo/6105920698.html,Room sublet June - July - August,725.0,oakland west,,,"['laundry on site', 'street parking', 'no private bath', 'private room']"," Hi, I'm subletting my room in West Oakland for 2 months this summer. I'm planning to leave in July but can be flexible and move out as early as June, if you need to move in sooner. Here's a bit more info: It's a small 3br/1ba apartment in West Oakland, about a mile north of Downtown Oakland. We're a 15 minute walk to MacArthur BART, 20 minutes to 19th St BART, and a 25 minute walk to Frank Ogawa Plaza, and the AC Transit 18 line is right outside the door. Quick walking distance to several grocery stores, a pharmacy and just a couple of blocks away from 880 and 580 on-ramps. Street parking is a mixed bag: it's pretty safe to leave your car on the street, but sometimes you might have to park up to two blocks away. The rent is $725, including utilities+WiFi. The apartment is pretty small overall, with the kitchen opening up into the living room area. Our kitchen is well-stocked with basically everything you need to cook. The bathroom is cozy too, and the water pressure is great. The front of the house has small patio with a table and chairs, and some decorative plants. We also have a little, neglected backyard that gets a good amount of sunlight in spring and summer. The room itself is about 10x12 ft. It has a small closet and gets a good amount of natural light. It would be ideal for someone who has a minimal amount of stuff, since the only additional storage we have is in the laundry room, that's also small. It comes with an Ikea shelf and a comfy futon. The downside to this apartment is that the floorboards and walls are thin, so you'll definitely hear noise from upstairs (dropping things, yapping dog, running, etc.). This has gotten better lately though, and is pretty tolerable, though it's definitely not a good situation for a light sleeper or anyone looking for a quiet refuge; all three rooms can hear activity and conversation in the common areas. Generally, we try to keep it pretty quiet after 10-ish. There are two other roommates living in the house: S: I am the master tenant and have been in the unit for three years. I am 30 and work as a data analyst in public health. I'm from Sacramento but have a lot of family in Mexico, who I go to see as often as I can. In my free time I do some photography, take flamenco dance classes, and read. My drink of choice is Irish whiskey, and I'll have a friend or two over for drinks and dinner maybe 2-3 times a month. I'm very friendly and sociable, and I like most people that I meet. IG: @slcvz D: Coming soon Smoking and 420 is okay outside. Unfortunately, we cannot consider pets, as much as we'd like to. In your response to the ad, please tell us about yourself and your schedule, and what you expect from a shared household. We're excited to hear from you! ",37.820497,-122.270751

Owner is a non-intrusive older male songwriter, composer and author, who boards dogs. At any time I'll have from one to five dogs hanging out here, though usually two. I take in dogs through Rover.com. All dogs are vetted for personality and tameness. My renters who have lived here along with the dogs have never been asked to participate in their care in any way. You can have your own dog, but as it would limit the number of dogs I could take in, there would be an extra monthly charge of $300. The kitchen and bathroom are shared. All utilities are included. I am looking for a quiet, responsible, young single person, either employed or a college student. You must be financially solvent. No loud music or illegal drugs. I do not like rap, so if you're a fan this place is not for you. GF or BF overnighters are okay, they just can't live here. I'm busy all the time, so my roommate must keep long stories short. Queer females are okay, but straight guys only. (This is legal for roommate situations in California per Fair Housing Council v. Roommate.com.) I have been renting the room for 18 years, and have had roommates living here from 3 months to three years, so I've gotten along with many different people. I've rented to a divorce lawyer, a former Marine, a working actor and a current member of the Richmond City Council. I prefer the company of intelligent, well-educated young people with an optimistic view of the world (despite the current government). If you believe in the Rapture, and/or like the altRight, I may eventually have to shoot you, so it's best if you look somewhere else. If you feel stating these preferences may be illegal, please recognize that a roommate situation is not the same as renting a discrete unit. Stating my preferences here can save you a visit, so it's really in your best interest. The deposit is $600 and the rent is $700 ($1000 with a dog). Return of the deposit is contingent on a minimum four-months' stay. In your response please include your full name, age, gender, and current occupation or school. I'd also like to hear why you're moving. Please communicate via craigslist's email. I don't rent to people I can't meet first in person, and don't respond to people who ask if the room is still available but don't tell me anything about themselves. Aside from its proximity to amenities, the main advantage of living here is that you get to live around dogs. Dogs normally exert a calming and cheerful influence on people, especially when in their own company. Close drive to: I-80 and 580/Pt.

You get your own bedroom of course AND your own bathroom AND an extra half-room space. A washer and dryer are inside the apartment. ABOUT THE SHARING I'm looking for a QUIET, clean, responsible, considerate roommate. Because I have shared the space previously with several roommates and know what works best, I spell it all out here. That makes the process easier. Please bear with me... The available bedroom, half room, and bathroom are on the ground floor. My bedroom and bathroom are on the upper floor, along with the kitchen and living room. It's a shoes-off home. I'm looking for someone really quiet, for example a graduate student who'll be studying a lot or someone who works outside the home and likes to read when home. A lot of music over loudspeakers or constant TV blaring won't work here because I work from home a lot--mostly days but often at night. Even long phone calls can be distracting in this space. Sound travels easily between the bedrooms (even loud snoring is easy to hear between the rooms!). The apartment is quite nice, but noise has to be managed. Fortunately our neighbors are super quiet. My bedroom doubles as my home office, so I spend a lot of my free time in the kitchen and living room, where I camp out usually in the evenings and parts of the weekends. So what works best here is someone who spends their time mostly in their room or the half-room outside their bedroom and uses the living room only occasionally (daytimes, mainly), giving me priority there nights. To balance this, you have the extra space outside your bedroom in addition to parking in the attached garage (for a medium or small vehicle). I use the living room only occasionally during the day, usually on weekends, and use the kitchen for most meals. ABOUT YOU Here's who I'm looking for: someone fairly quiet, responsible, considerate, mature, and environmentally conscious (not always leaving on lights, etc.). You don't mind living in a shoes-off home. You don't use scented products in the house (I have allergies) and don't smoke. You won't be cooking meat at home (I'm vegetarian). You have a regular day job out of the house or are a student on campus most of the day (I work from home). You have excellent references that I can contact. If this all fits you, then I'd like to hear from you. ABOUT THE PLACE The two-story unit is nicer than most Berkeley apartments. It's in a 3-unit 1930's building completely rebuilt from the foundation up around 1998. Most of the original design and details were kept. The landlord maintains the apartment in great condition. We're in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood: near the corner of Channing Way and California St. (one walk-able mile from UC Berkeley, two blocks from shops and buses at Sacramento & Dwight, a fifteen-minute walk to downtown Berkeley, an easy bike ride around Berkeley). The available bedroom opens up to a tiny outdoor patio and a small plot where a few plants could be grown. That's one of the four external entrances to the apartment and can be used as a private entrance. There are also exterior doors into the living room, kitchen, and garage. The available average-sized bedroom and full bath (with shower and tub) are on the ground floor, which is mostly carpeted (the shared spaces have mostly hardwood floors). Your personal space also includes an ""extra"" space (a small open room between your bedroom and bathroom). A small amount of storage is available in the garage. The available room and half room are unfurnished. The living room and kitchen are pretty well furnished, so not much more furniture is needed there. Sorry, the lease doesn't allow pets. No smoking in or near the unit. Broadband Internet is set up to cover the whole apartment; it can be shared very cheaply (about $12/mo. each). Electric, gas, and water bills are shared equitably. ABOUT ME I'm a man 55 years old, respectful toward other peoples' living spaces, and have had success living with others who are also respectful and sensitive. I'm a fairly quiet Ph.D. holder doing scholarly work in environmental studies including college-level teaching and have traveled in dozens of countries. I've spent a lot of time in East Asia, including Indonesia and Japan. Politically progressive, environmentally focused, a native New Englander. I play an Asian bamboo flute (professionally sometimes), but not for long periods in the home usually, and usually only in the living room. Please tell me about yourself and how you plan to live in your home. Thanks for reading. I hope to hear from you if you think it would work. ",37.864267,-122.279098

This is not a specific job or time commitment but takes someone who loves dogs and enjoys living with them. It means letting the dogs outside in the yard when you come home and then calling them back inside (if you arrive home when we are not home). If we're home nothing to do. Then, if from time to time we go out of town, would mean feeding the dogs, and making sure they're let in and out at least twice a day. This would be arranged in advance. The room is a very bright and cheerful room, lots of light, and a walk-in closet. The room measures 220 sq. ft. The room is furnished with a bed, dresser, night stand, rug, desk and chair. There is also a living room on the same floor as the room, which is our second living room, and would also be for your use as well. Free wifi. We split the cost of the rest of the utilities per month, divided by the number of household occupants. Deposit is $500. No credit check. Great personal/professional references are needed. You: responsible, kind and genuinely likes animals, and must *love dogs*, and we have both cats and dogs. You: a *vegetarian or vegan*. Our family & one of the two housemates are vegetarian or vegan. The other housemate eats fish & chicken... In the future when she moves will then be an all veg house. We are looking for a non-smoker only. Sorry, no more pets. We are in a good part of Vallejo. We have a very spacious, Turn-of-the-Century, 3-story Victorian Farmhouse. We also have a large park-like yard, with garden and trees, and an outside back patio to have your tea/coffee. Near to the waterfront, shopping, twice weekly Farmer's market (Wednesday & Saturday) (nearby Benicia has a Farmer's Market Thursday & Sunday so could go to a close by Farmer's Market 4x a week), art galleries, art house movie theater, with movies, live jazz, comedy and other events, cafes, and restaurants. There's a bus right by the house that goes downtown, & to the waterfront. There's both the commuter ferry & the Transbay bus that runs multiple times daily to San Francisco, 7 days a week. The ferry has two levels with indoor/outdoor seating & a cafe inside. The Transbay bus is not a regular city bus, but a luxury coach bus with comfortable seats, ample room. There's a parking lot at the waterfront where you catch the ferry or Transbay bus, & a very nice coffee shop to get your coffee, before catching the ferry or bus. The closest BART is El Cerrito, a 12 min. drive. There's a bus that goes to the BART station as well. Additionally, there's a casual carpool in town that runs to San Francisco. The wonderful town of Benicia is a 5 minute car ride and they also have a terrific farmer's market twice a week (Thursday & Sunday), and lots of evening and weekend events going on, and many terrific restaurants, night life. We are very centrally located: 20 mins. to Berkeley, 22 mins. to Oakland, 35 mins. to San Francisco, 20 mins. to San Rafael, 10 mins. to Martinez, 20 mins to Concord, 25 mins. to Walnut Creek, 25 mins. to Pittsburgh/Bay Point, 15 mins. to Fairfield & 15 mins. to Napa. Our household consists of a woman early 40's, working professional, in education, and a teenage son, age 17, homeschooled and in high school, and 18 year old daughter in college (music/pre-med). We live on the second and third floors. We also have a nice man, a mathematics professor/tutor, in his mid 50's, who rents a studio room on the 1st floor, and a nice woman in her mid 30's, who works in management, who rents a two room suite on the 1st floor. You would share the 1st floor kitchen with them. Our house is a very spacious 10 bedroom, 3-story Victorian with 4500 sq. ft., and plenty of room for everyone. We have a Washer/Dryer. We are a completely non-smoking/drug-free household, which includes no smoking marijuana. If interested, please send a detailed email telling us about yourself, your current housing situation, and what you are looking for in housing. ",,

I will be in Massachusetts from May 1 - the end of August so I'd like to find the right roommate before I leave if possible. I have learned that initial qualifiers are important so here it goes: -I am a white, bi, German immigrant, cis-female school social worker. I am 420 happy and sex-positive. -Preferences will be given to POC, female-identified, gender queer, and otherwise marginalized folks -No other pets may accommodate the space -Unfortunately you have to have a car and be able to walk up and down some rather precarious stairs to access the place -Clear communication, shared chores, and respectful cohabitation are a must Some of the good stuff: -$750/month is a great deal! -Free laundry on site -Tons of built in drawers and dressers so you don't need to bring any -Within walking distance of epic hiking trails in Redwood Regional and Huckleberry Preserve -Away from the city -My cats are lovers -Private parking Some of the draw backs: -Far away from the city -My cats are lovers (for folks with allergies, this might be a no-go) -The carpet has seen better days -Permanent parking is available for tenants but guest parking is limited If you are or know somebody who is in search for housing, please send them my way. General description of the place: The apartment has a small private deck looking out at lush redwoods and eucalyptus trees, which is why I like to call this my little treehouse. The spot is within walking distance to dog-friendly hiking and biking trails in Redwood Regional Park and Huckleberry Reserve. My little treehouse is graced with a separate laundry room. Right now, the space has a fully furnished kitchen and bedroom but this is flexible if you'd like to bring your own furniture. There is tons of built in storage in the treehouse. The apartment is heated with forced air and the space is supplemented by a clean-burning pellet stove. The place is fully carpeted except for some tiles in bathroom and laundry rooms and wood floors in the kitchen. The bathroom is small but comes with great storage. No tub, just stand up shower. This space has a touch of the rustic so be ready for fully functioning, but older quirks. I find its ambiance quite pleasant. It has a non-traditional layout. Entry is through a sliding glass door. There is off-street parking for two cars. No smoking inside the apartment or elsewhere on the property. The space is only accessible by car or bicycle (for those of you who have a serious biking hobby) - public transit does not reach up this far into the steep hills. Also, unfortunately you have to be able to walk down and up some steep stairs in order to access the apartment. $750/month + utilities ($90-$150/ mo depending on usage) Deposit = One month's rent plus $1000 If you're interested, please write and tell me about yourself and put ""supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" in your subject line.

You'll have a decent-sized room (9' x 12.5') with a huge walk-in closet. The room is unfurnished, but the rest of the space is fully outfitted (kitchen, living room, etc). If you have dishes and such we can make some space. We have a nice private patio out back, with a small table and chairs and plants. There is secured parking available for $100/mo, or $150 for a tandem space. There are two coin-op laundry rooms within easy access. If you have extra stuff to stash, there's storage available in the basement of one of the buildings for around $75-100/mo, which I'm taking advantage of. Total rent is $2750/mo, with a community fee of $108 which covers water, gas/heat (stove/oven), garbage, and high-speed internet (Paxio); so your half would be $1429/mo. We only pay electric separately, and I haven't had a bill higher than $50 in the past year. I'm north of 30, work full-time at UCSF and aspire to getting back into running. Pretty standard working professional, not terribly exciting during the week, weekends are hit or miss - sometimes busy, sometimes just relaxing and catching up on housework. I'm vegan and prefer the same, but open to vegetarians, or open-minded and respectful individuals (I strongly prefer not to have meat around or cooked in the kitchen or on my dishes, but we can probably find a compromise if you can work with that). I have 2 dogs, Pinky and Loki (featured in the photo). My senior dog Loki isn't good with other pets, so additional pets while he's around will be difficult unless they can safely and easily be contained to your room. If you're a cat person, there is a managed feral cat colony that hangs around, and a couple of residents feed and care for. My pups can be enthusiastic, but you'll be hard pressed to find anyone else as happy as them to see you come home, especially if you offer them a treat. They're not perfectly mannered, but they are very well house-trained, and very bribable and generally eager to please. My ideal roommate would be pretty mellow, but keep the dishes cleaned up and trash taken out, and up for trading off cleaning chores. No smoking/420 at home (I don't care what your lifestyle involves, but I don't like the smell), more dinner party or board game night than rager-style parties at home. It'd be nice to be friends, but not required, just able to be civil and keep things clean is cool too (and rent paid reliably on time). Not particular about gender, or inclinations, as long as everyone is respectful and keeps things reasonably quiet, particularly on weeknights. Overnight guests are welcome as long as they respect the space and community, and get introduced to the dogs so no one has an unpleasant surprise. Just no creeps, please. :) The complex quiet hours are 10pm - 8am every day, it's rare that I hear much noise even outside those hours when I'm actually home. If all that sounds appealing or manageable to you, send me an email with a little about yourself. ",37.835926,-122.27708

We have a room available for rent! Its a 11X12 room with a shared bathroom in a single family home. The house has been remodeled over the last few years with recent changes having happened last year. The room is unfurnished but the rest of the house is furnished or will be in the next few weeks. Currently we are in the midst of furnishing the living rooms (one of which will be a place to relax with either a pool table, poker table, etc.). Apart from that, there is a big backyard-suitable for bbq's, hangouts, etc. Street/Driveway parking. You will have full access to the kitchen as well as the rest of the house. You will have three roommates- two of which are college students and one who is a full time professional working in the tech industry. We get along well and like to hang out The way the house is set up, your room is isolated from the living rooms so noise shouldn't be an issue - but we are very conscious of roommates schedules if we do have a get together. The way I'd describe it is that your renting more than a room, your renting a big chunk of the house. Access to common areas, garage, backyard (including a 10x10 shed) is equal among all roommates. We are looking for either a student or a professional who is clean, courteous, but also social! We are relaxed on rules as long as everyone looks after themselves. Rent will be $900.00 plus split utilities. First months rent/$1000 deposit due. Available May 1st! The landlord has been going back and forth on whether to allow pets. Pets will be allowed as long as they are trained. The backyard is huge (enough room to run around). There will be an additional $500 deposit required per pet though.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/roo/6104874588.html,Room to rent in vegan 2BR everything-included Berkeley / N. Berkeley,820.0,berkeley,2017-05-17,650,"['no laundry on site', 'street parking', 'no private bath', 'private room']"," Vegan * Tobacco-free * A cat lives here * Living room has turntables and dance records Pros: Chill roommate, vegan, good location, musical space // Cons: Not much storage, not a newish space, no dishwasher or on-site laundry. A 12'x10' room is available May 17th. The place is a ground-floor 2-bedroom, and I am the only roommate. This is an opportunity for a positive living situation. Being a good roommate is a moral imperative, and is self-evident. I always try to be cordial, without being disingenuous. Rent includes everything, including wifi. Smokers of commercial tobacco cigarettes need not apply. Moderate and possibly heavy users of 215 are encouraged to apply (though I am sober, I am well aware of the benefits and lifestyle). Vegans/vegetarians are preferred as well, because the kitchen is 100% vegan. There is a cat that comes in sometimes, so if you are allergic to cats this probably will not work for you. The space is mostly likely too small for anymore pets, but I will consider it. The living room is mostly dedicated to analog music production. I am an avid do-it-yourself-er and have a nice stash of tools. I am open to assisting my roommate with DIY projects. To mention a little about me: I am an SF native who moved here awhile back. I like animals, guitars, singing, hiking, skating, cooking, dancing, drumming, equality, and sustainability. I work around my roommate's schedule if necessary as far as recording music tracks. I try to be accommodating when it comes to noise. Much of the work necessary in the music business does not necessitate being loud. Right now, I am working from home about half-time (mostly tech work). I am working on a solo record with high-end four-track recorders. I have a part-time job as well. Vegan roommates are preferred. On another note, I have been around violent and/or narcissistic people in the past. I have also associated with drug-addicts in the past, mostly unknowingly. I am hoping to keep those types of experiences in the past, unless I take up social work as a new career. Cleverly put ""tempeh"" in your response title so I know you actually read the ad. So many dimwits neglect to read it and it's painfully obvious in their responses. If you lack sanity/empathy and/or do hard drugs regularly, please do not waste my time. I have techniques for screening out that element, so don't bother. The available room has a closet, of course, and a bed-frame if you desire. The room is in the back, so it is quiet. It is a good size, but does not have much of a view. I clean the common areas, and wash all the dishes 3x/week. This is a sweet location. Trader Joe's and BART are close, as well as a good park. Out-of-the-Closet is 1.5 blocks north. For all you skaters, I have a quarter-pipe. Most of the communal space has been converted for music production/rehearsal and DIY/shop, but there is a couch for chilling in the living room. I am not uptight about my gear, but I may insist you use your own headshells or chip in for strings / heads. Parking is OK in the neighborhood, and it is usually pretty quiet. The kitchen is a decent size, but there is no dishwasher. The bathroom is pretty new, which is great. The floors are showing some wear, but are hanging tough. I sweep and mop as needed. The studio gear occupies much of the communal area so I can't offer storage beyond the available room and some kitchen cabinet space. I have been here awhile, so I have most kitchen stuff. It has been great when my roommate and I have been able to team-up on macrobiotic meals. I am a talented self-taught chef. I finally nailed restaurant style a few years back. All my roommates have liked my food. I like getting good ingredients and slow-cooking. It also helps if you do not have a lot of stuff, since much storage is dedicated to shop/DIY. I wrench on cars and currently am working on the Toyota 20r engine, a classic, extremely durable one from the 70's (carbureted). The gem of this place is the patio we share with neighbors. There is a good amount of space and pots for growing food, though noone has taken ownership on this front. Maybe you are that person. I am a techie / audio-artist (PC expert, networks, websites, DJ, blues musician). Part of the living room functions as a vinyl DJ studio. The turntables are decent, but not Technics. There is a bass amp, guitar amp, and some drums stored against the wall. I have a nice stash of acoustic instruments, from bass to mandolin. Any gear in the living area is communal. Thus it helps if you are in the music industry, or do music for fun. Otherwise you might start to resent that most of the communal space is dedicated to audio production/entertainment and PC-building. As far as musical taste, I started with the blues, but branched out to everything. I would consider a drum kit in the living area, if we agreed on it, and I have one. If you appreciate a progressive / artistic mindset, and don't need to live in a ""new"" place, come check this place out. Ever listen to KPFA? Are you looking to avoid mass-media consuming, insensitive roommates? An $800 deposit is required on the room, unless we negotiate otherwise. You must stay three months to get your deposit back. There is a small work bench/closet, and I have a lot of tools. It would be great if you are DIY or DIY-friendly. I'd appreciate someone who is self-aware, mature, and independent. I am quiet after eleven, because I use headphones out of consideration for my roommate and neighbors. Quiet time ends at 7AM, but if you have to get up early for work, you might have to make some noise before 7AM. Being a good roommate is pretty easy if you have a healthy lifestyle, employ common sense and are generally aware. I have these attributes, and hope you do too. I will also provide technical and DIY (including mechanical) support to my roommate. Good luck, and thanks for stopping by. Living here is epic. California street rocks.

Room is available starting Sunday, May 7th. Must be able to meet in person. The property is a 15 minute walk from MacArthur Bart, and very close to the Safeway/Pak 'N Save on 40th and Lanesplitter Pizza on San Pablo. It's also adjacent to the 580 freeway entrance (which is currently under construction until June.) The apartment is on the third floor, very light and open, and the bedroom is spacious (about 13x13) with a closet unit installed. Room is unfurnished. Rent is $967 per person per month and utilities/internet are about $90 per person each month. There are two bathrooms in the unit and one contains a washer and dryer. Secure parking spaces are also available for a $50/month fee. Rental agreement is month-to-month. Regarding the move in process, the landlord requires a $2000 deposit per person (in addition to the monthly rent payment), for a total of $2967 upon move in. The landlord also requires proof of income and will need to run a credit check (this will be covered by the $35 submitted with rental application). The housemates: Josh: 28 year old QA Engineer at company in Emeryville. Enjoys ultimate frisbee and games of all sorts (board games, card games, video games.) Chill, usually out and about due to busy schedule. Iris: 29 years old, works in marketing at an advertising company in Emeryville. Enjoys reading, Netflix, playing guitar and napping. We're both looking for a roommate who is respectful, responsible, keeps things neat in the apartment, and who is okay with the independent lifestyles within the house. Also, someone looking for a longer term housing situation (1+ year) would be preferred. The property is on West MacArthur and Market, so if you are unfamiliar with Oakland, we recommend driving by to check out the neighborhood first. The apartment is on the third (top) floor of the complex and is only accessible via stairs at this time. Also, no pets are allowed on the property.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/roo/6104781003.html,Seeking a Housemate for Our Intentional West Oakland Communal Home,885.0,oakland north / temescal,,,"['no private bath', 'private room']"," ** Bedroom - $885 - available May 15 ** Are you the right person to complete our house? Five of us have moved in together over the last 8 months, inspired and motivated by the idea of a house that is more than a co-living space. We are housemates, but we are also friends, collaborators, instigators and partners in creating a more connected community and a more just world. Our home is the platform for our personal and collective (r)evolution. It is a space for gatherings and workshops that bring together folks from different communities, and it is the container in which we explore how to show up in the world in alignment with our values and our deepest truths. We have one bedroom open and are looking for a permanent housemate... or temporary subletter to enjoy the space while we find the right peeps to co-create with us. Sorry no dogs or cats (unless you have a special hypoallergenic cat) THE HOUSE The house is a beautifully-remodeled early 20th century Victorian with 4 large bedrooms, 1 basement bedroom, a living room and dining room (both with large bay windows), big kitchen, endless storage space, and a large backyard. As you can see from the photos, the living room space has padded floors for dancing, yoga or just rolling around the floor. The backyard has a small veggie garden, a fire pit, and a large aerial rig for doing aerial silks. The basement sprawls out with lots of space for storage and crafting/workshop-type work but it has a low (~6 ft.) ceiling. The house is located on 32nd St, in between West and MLK. If you google map the address, it looks like it's somewhat close to the highway but, to our surprise, we found highway noise to be minimal (and no noise from BART either). The house is 7 blocks away from MacArthur Bart (0.7 miles), 1.1 miles from 19th St BART (10 min bike ride) and downtown Oakland, 1.5 miles to Lake Merritt. The neighborhood is diverse and urban. To live here and be happy here, you have to want to live in West Oakland and to have be aware of what it means to be a gentrifier, and be interested in learning how to live in community and solidarity with the folks in our neighborhood. If you are uncomfortable engaging with this process, this is not the house for you. THE ROOM The room is 13 feet by 12 feet, on the second floor of the house (sorry, not wheelchair accessible), with a nice-sized closet. It has nice windows but they look toward the adjacent building (we have lowered the rent to take into account the not-so-nice view). You would be a sharing a bathroom with 3 other folks, although the downstairs bathrooms are available as well and we've never found bathroom usage to be an issue (there are 3 full bathrooms in the house---one on each floor). The price of the room is $885 and it's available May 1st. THE VISION We live in a critical moment in history. The election exposed a lot of the dynamics and forms of injustice that many of us have been aware for a long while. It also exposed the cost of living in our bubbles and othering those who speak, act or dress differently than we do. How do we break down social barriers and use our power to protect lives and create a world that works for all? Many of us have worked on personal growth and freedom but do we know what collective freedom looks like? Our home is a space to engage with these questions and co-create with intention. It is a space to do deep personal work around unpacking our patterns and social conditioning. It is a space to do interpersonal work/connecting: how can we as a group of five and our extended community model the kind of conflict-resolution and acceptance of differences that we wish to see our society move toward? And it is a space from which we run a few evolving community projects: a ""Creative Resistance"" action on Inauguration Day (for example), a Love in Action facebook group, etc. US YoYo - I am an attorney, an activist, an organizer, a dancer, an aerialist (kinda), a facilitator of healing and transformation. I am passionate about helping people get in touch with themselves and with one another. And what I am really about is shifting the systems that we operate in from ones based on separation and exploitation to ones founded on connection, liberation and unconditional love. I am a white-racialized bisexual woman, originally from Bulgaria, in my late 20s. JJ - I'm a dancer, adventurer, in support of bringing more love and freedom into the World. After a long career in tech, and a beautiful stretch of spiritual seeking, I've found myself more and more interested in making the world a more just and love-filled place. I spend my days volunteering with social justice and non-duality groups here in the bay area. Meanwhile I enjoy my partnership with YoYo, dancing, and adventuring off to climb mountains in the Sierra and Beyond. I'm a mixed race man in my early 40s. James - I am a silly short human being with a passion for the outdoors and the arts. I enjoy playing the drums and engaging in conversation. Oh yeah I love laughing, acro yoga, crunchy conversations, questions, chocolate, and genuine humans who don't feel the need to ""sugar"" coat their opinions and feelings. In life in just trying to keep it real and keep it right, I dislike writing about myself, and I am a 20 something mixed race master meticulously mending my miseducated mind. Tomas - I am a writer and organizer who spends my days working to create a more inclusive labor system and my mornings and nights expanding the spirit. I practice Aztec dance, Qi Gong, surfing, cycling and playing music. I've recently returned to the Bay after being in the Northeast for 6 years and am enthralled by my native California. Early 20's. Jamie - I am a meditator, an educator, a general lover of life. I'm into dancing, hiking, writing, Sufism, Buddhism, the wisdom of nature, the philosophy of self. I have always found myself most at home with the radicals and the mystics of any group. By day, I teach a writing course about the power and possibility of love as a source of personal healing and social change. By night, I sleep. I'm a 32-year-old, cis white woman. I would love to talk with you about whatever lights up your eyes. YOU We are looking for someone who is: - Mature and self-aware - Playful, creative, vibrant, excited to contribute to the house - Aligned with our vision of supporting personal growth AND taking action for broader social justice - Experienced in communal living, or very interested and committed to delving into communal living, and has the space in their life to be present and contribute their time (and gifts) to the home. - Ideally someone with experience working with marginalized communities or from a marginalized community.

I don't care if you do as long as it isn't the focus of your life and any real partying is generally done away from home. About the Cats - Cloudy and Stormy are three year old cats that are very friendly and lovable. Thunder is the baby of the family at one.

I have lived here for the past 3 years and previously lived about 2 blocks from this place since 2006. I love this neighborhood more than anywhere else that I have lived in the Bay Area (SF Mission, Bernal Heights, Piedmont, Pacifica, Emeryville). The place is a 3 bedroom house with 1400 sq/ft. Two of the bedrooms will be occupied by myself and my 8 year old son. The 3rd bedroom is 10' x 12', and will rent for $825/mo. Lake Merritt BART is less than a mile away. Laundry is on site; washer / dryer in the apartment. Garbage & water are included with rent; PG&E is additional. There is a small yard out front with suitable space for garden beds (if you're up for that challenge). Looking for someone to move in by June 1st. ME: 40 year old science / computer science teacher at a junior high school in Moraga. I have previously worked as a community / labor organizer & social worker; I have also lived in communal settings, love to cook, share, converse, garden, hike, and camp. Left-leaning political views. I enjoy seeing live music and playing it (guitar / banjo). I am thoughtful, straight forward, honest, and easy going. A clean, organized house is important to me. My son is a real sweetheart, who loves animals, climbing, drawing, science, and building. He's very imaginative and creative. He's only at my house half of the time (usually Thurs-Sun), but when he is there it will need to be sleepably quiet after 8:30pm. YOU: Mature, thoughtful, responsible, clean, easy going, and straight forward. You will need to be willing to agree to taking on your part of the shared household responsibilities and to monthly check-ins about the state of the household / bills / etc. You must be completely OK with living with an 8 year old kid (who has a lot of energy). It is very important to me that my roommate is aware and thoughtful of what is an appropriate environment for a child to grow up in (loud, late nights simply will not work). No smoking. Things will probably work out best if you have somewhat radical & progressive political views as well. If any of the above sounds like it might be a good fit, please email me to further discuss the details. ",37.796356,-122.244465

You will be housemate number seven! It's important to us that you have great communication skills and previous experience living with roommates. We are a somewhat communal house, but we are pretty laid back in terms of house meetings and house dinners. We try to get together at least once a month, and do fun things in addition to taking care of house business. It takes a lot to keep our home clean and cozy. Everyone is expected to do their share of chores throughout the month, but we also have a monthly cleaning service to get into all those little nooks and crannies. We are looking for someone who is self-sufficient and does their own thing, but also contributes to the energy of the house. We love laughing and sharing stories together, cooking delicious, healthy meals in our super spacious kitchen, playing funk & blues music, holding yoga and meditation sessions in the living room and watching the sunset from our stellar deck with a view of the Bay while talking about consciousness. Sometimes we go hiking together in Redwood or Sibley Park, which are both less than a five-minute drive from the house. Traditionally, we enjoy one or two house trips a year to Tahoe or camping! We also have a front yard and back yard with some fruit trees and ample gardening grounds. Bonus points if you have a green thumb! We're looking for someone who is self-motivated and works outside the house (If you work from home, please do not reply). Ideally, you are between the ages of 25-35. It is essential that you have great communication skills! We have a group text that we communicate through and we use it on a pretty regular basis to keep up with what's going on around the house. We're a busy bunch and even though there are seven of us, the house always feels spacious and is usually fairly quiet. A bit about us: C: 27 - About to graduate with her Master's in Integrative Health Studies - interested in bringing mind, body, spirit into health care and exploring alternative and holistic therapies. Loves hiking, dancing, being silly, going to music festivals, meditating, snowboarding and having friends over for dinner. R: 26 - Musician in a funk band and a full-time music teacher - he enjoys live music, the outdoors, and connecting with good people A: 33 - Psychologist and AcroYoga teacher - she's originally from NY, enjoys adventures, community, a place to share and call home with others, & travel! Can be found doing a handstand or interpretive dance, en route to hot springs.... D: 28 - Beer Marketing Professional. She enjoys the gym, hiking, beaches, books, travel. Looking for honest, respectful, outgoing housemate that enjoys community living but respects personal and communal space. A: 23 - Musician and Bartender - originally from Nashville, TN. She enjoys poetry, tiny cups, and talking about consciousness and why people do what they do. K: 27 - Painter - Loves climbing, surfing, and snowboarding. Spends most weekends in Tahoe or Yosemite. The room is on the second floor and you will be sharing a bathroom with two other housemates. It comes with a loft for your bed and a gorgeous view of the bay! We are looking for someone who can commit to at least one year. We have one sweet, adorable cat named Rosie and one sweet adorable bunny named Tomato. Unfortunately, the landlord does not allow dogs, but we are open to having another cat if they meet Rosie first and get along. Rent: $800/month + Utilities ($75-100/month) Deposit: $800 Preference to a male applicants to keep our ratio even. No couples. You must pass credit check and you will be signing a lease.

Oakland,825.0,oakland north / temescal,,,"['w/d in unit', 'street parking', 'private bath', 'private room']"," If this posting is still up, the room is still available. Apologies to those who have emailed and have not received a response. We've had a lot of responses and are working through them as time permits, but have not been able to interview much over the past week because one housemate has been out of town. We have an unfurnished (or partially furnished) single occupancy room, available immediately (as of April 1), for rent in North Oakland near 61st and Dover Street. The house is shared with two other people, one male, one female, and we are looking for someone who is willing to stay on as a tenant for at least a year. The house has two bathrooms, one on the main floor, and one in the room we are seeking to rent, laundry on site, hardwood floors throughout the downstairs, a very small kitchen, nice living room, and limited closet space. The room itself also has fairly limited closet space, so would likely be best for someone without a huge amount of stuff. The male housemate is 30, and is a former UM/UCB philosophy student, currently attempting (possibly futilely) to start a business. His primary interests are in philosophy, law, politics, mechanics / industrial design. In his free time he enjoys photography, nature, exploring small towns, working on diesel engines, volunteering with prisoner rights groups, and listening to terrifying classical music. The female housemate is in her late twenties and is originally from San Diego. In her free time she volunteers with organizations that do work around immigration, is a member of a WOC collective that organizes in Oakland, and goes to shows. The house is not particularly lively, as we both have somewhat strange schedules and tend to keep to ourselves. If you like coming home to a quiet space and are ok with your housemates not always being around, then this would be a good fit. We try to keep the place clean, quiet, and pet-free. This means that we are seeking a housemate who will clean up after him or herself, do dishes, help with household chores, etc., and also not have any pets. The building itself is large and subdivided into multiple apartment units and the landlord lives in one of the adjacent units, so we really cannot have parties or make a lot of noise. We're open to applicants of all racial / sexual / gender / etc., identities. A deposit of $1000 must be paid to the landlord along with the first month's rent, so the total required to move in will be $1850, we also share utilities, which tend to average about 20 per month per person for internet, and 60 per month for other utilities, although this various between months. We will be running credit checks, but will only ask to do so if you end up on a short list of prospective housemates. Also, absolutely no smoking indoors, no hard drugs, no slobs. If you think you would be a good fit, please respond with a brief description of your background, interests, and current situation. Also feel free to include links to social media accounts if you think they will help us to get a better idea of who you are as a person. Thanks for reading, hope to hear from you!

Great care was taken to re-build this home taking its history into account. Re-using knotty pine tongue and groove solid wood paneling , original doors, and hardwood floors, too keep some of the flavor of this classic Oakland hills home is important. The classic vaulted ceilings in the living room, kitchen and upstairs bedroom were retained to keep the charm and the feel of ""Cottage in the woods"" flavor of this home. The floor to ceiling design of the windows was kept too, while replacing the actual windows with new, insulated energy efficient, and safe glazing. All new electrical, and appliances were installed and integrated with great care to preserve the charm in 2014 while making this home easy to live in and function with modern convenience. Move-in requirements are first month rent and security deposit equal to the first month's rent. The room is unfurnished, (picture shows furniture) and the move-in date is available now. The lease is month-to-month. About the me: I am a mature male professional food artist and instructor, with a rich collection of friends and community here in the Bay Area. I am, at the core of what I do, an artist - but spending a lot of time on building a business and instructing courses. As social as I am, I seek serene environments and nature as much as possible in this hectic world we live in. I am a busy person, but home a lot - and I am also out of town on occasion. Ideally you have a 9-5 job. I am reliable and seek the same with open communication. Dynamics: It would be wonderful if you are person with a sense of community and want to have a glass of wine or dinner on occasion - as well as independent and fine on your own. Important you are willing to share the few minor chores and agreements around the house, like taking off shoes, cleaning your dishes and dealing with the weekly chores and trash, and watering of plants. Dinner parties and friends are part of the mix, offered with a good balance of quiet to provide refuge needed. One note: I am not a big TV person and don't have a TV. If you want to put in a TV in your room, you can -- but there's no cable and I would appreciate you have some small speakers. My last roommate had a set up that worked out fine, so I'm not adverse... I just need to have peace when I need peace versus a horror movie or sports network droning in the background. If that's a deal killer I understand. More Details: There is some extra storage for those bulky items such as taxes. There is dedicated parking outside the house . There is a laundry room with a stacking w/d, wear and tear on the machines is the renter's responsibility (ie: if they break, we replace them) Don't expect to be navigating around our dirty clothes or dishes. The place is clean and remains so. Hopefully that works for you too. And you like being clean. Other notes: While this is not a clean and sober place, this is a responsible household. Absolutely no hard core drugs, nor alcoholics. If you love the white stuff...please move on. Fairly smoke free environment. 420 friendly - primarily in our own rooms and in the yard. Cigarette free. Also, this is not a party house. Certainly the 2am ""after party"" does not happen here. Although, there are holiday gathering, dinner parties, an odd jam and BBQ on the deck, these are planned. Your guest is welcome (constant company excluded), as long as you let us know, they respect the space and people in it and you clean up after them. Allergic? in the past, cats have been in the house (if you need to know). What else? While the place furnished in general, the change of roommates (from 3-2) will offer a wee bit more space to add furniture of good quality that is aesthetically harmonious. I am also willing to have your kitchen stuff replace my stuff -if it is top notch and better. Bottom line, while I can't accommodate a ton of furniture, your room is your palette and there is opportunity to explore options. How much is the rent again? Rent is $1075. Plus $75-120 for utilities, TOTAL COST of $1295 - what you will pay each month. Increases for energy and other costs if the utilities go up are shared if they go up. The rent goes up each year according to the rules of Oakland's rent control so it's stable. Measure EE for reference. This is a shared house, all renters are responsible for the house, not just the room that is occupied. Ideally you are a somebody who's willing to share the load if things come up and if the increase and utilities occur - everyone is expected to share those costs and the responsibility of turning off lights and turning down the heat. I'm looking for someone stable - Security deposit equal to the first months rent plus the first months rent. - Move in deposit is returned after move out (this means you pay the last months rent on your last month, and get this deposit back after you leave as long as you leave the place in tact). - Paperwork: Please provide 1. a full credit report with score (Experion, TransUnion or Equifax), 2. Three (3) references, 3. the standard rental application. 4. The full deposit to secure the room. I'm seeking a personable, clean, easy to live with person who is also responsible and has good credit. If you are interested, please send more details about yourself. IMPORTANT - a phone number to call you to set up a meeting. Please feel free to reach out anytime to schedule a meeting. ",37.770715,-122.167625

I'm looking for someone to rent one of the two bedrooms in my apartment. About me: I work in I.T. in the City, and have standard work hours. I'm laid-back, clean, and pretty quiet. I'm a 36 year-old cis male, and I have a dog (an Alaskan Malamute!) who lives with me in the apartment. He is ridiculously chill. This room is really large. You could easily fit a king-size bed in here, plus a desk and dresser/bookshelf. It's carpeted, and has a full-length closet that spans the entire back of the room. The entire place has really high-quality carpet, except for the kitchen (which has granite countertops), and that has a wood laminate floor, and the single bathroom, which is tiled. Electric stove/oven, plus a Breville Smart Oven Pro and a big Panasonic microwave. The bathroom is shared, and is fairly small, but has a shower/bathtub. I guess the only real downside of this apartment is it's not very bright, since it's on the first floor of the building. Sorry, but I can't rent to anyone with a pet of their own: my dog is the only animal allowed in the place. I'm also not interested in renting the room out to couples or folks with children living with them, sorry. You: I'd like to have a housemate who works similar shifts to me (9-6 M-F), if possible. It'd be best if you didn't always work from home, as well.I prefer someone who's got a steady income and good credit. I'd also prefer a commitment of at least 6 months, preferably longer. I'm LGBTQ friendly, and my dog loves just about everyone. This unit is in a condominium building. I am the master tenant, as well, so if there are any problems, you can just literally knock on my door! The place is a 2-bedroom 1-bathroom, 1st floor unit, with a huge kitchen, big living room (with two couches!), and a sunroom that's being used as a plant room. Don't worry, they're funky plants, but not weed. There is plenty of street parking near the building! You'd be 150 feet away from Piedmont Avenue, with all the awesome shops, restaurants, grocery store, pharmacy, bank...etc on it. It's a 10 minute walk straight down 40th Street to MacArthur BART station, and there are a bunch of AC Transit lines less than 2 minutes walk from the building. The rent is $1,500 per month, and there will be a $1,500 security deposit due on the first day of moving into the room. We would split the Comcast (internet only) bill in half, and we can negotiate about the electric bill. If you're interested, please send me a message with some information about yourself (specifically, what you do for a living/school/etc.). Please also include a link to your Facebook and/or LinkedIn profiles. Thanks! ",37.825904,-122.254915

My current lease is expiring on January 24th and I am looking to replace my roommate as she will be moving out. Ideally I am looking for someone to sign onto a new 15 month lease for me, but could potentially work out a sublet situation if that works better. About the apartment: -$500/ month for rent. Utilities ~$100 more -2 bedroom 2 bathroom, your bathroom is only accessible from within your room -In unit washer and dryer -$150 optional parking spot -Modern building with parking garage, 24 hour gym, pool, entertaining areas, front desk security -1 block from 19th St BART About me: I'm a 27 year old female who works as account manager for a solar company. My office is in the city, but my schedule can include some local or long distance travel, so not always the predictable ""9-5"". My hobbies include yoga, cooking, wine tasting, binge watching the newest craze (most recently Westworld), and going out with friends. I don't generally host parties at my apartment, but will have one or two friends over for dinner from time to time. I'm very clean / organized in common spaces and am not the type to leave things laying around or create messes that I don't clean up. I'm also very financially responsible. About you: I don't have a gender preference as I have lived with both males and females in the past. I'm most concerned about my future roommate having a stable income and being able to pay rent / utilities on time. I also appreciate someone who understands how to keep common areas clean and doesn't mind sharing some of the cleaning responsibility. If you're looking to make this a weekday party spot, this likely isn't the place for you. If you're someone who keeps it chill during the week, but enjoys doing things on the weekend, then we'll get along great! ",,

Available for rent is a shared room in Berkeley, right across the street from the UCB campus and a 1 minute walk to Telegraph Ave. It's super convenient if you're a student, or even if you aren't, there's always something you can do for fun within walking distance. It's a 15 min drive to the SF Bay and a 10 min walk from the Downtown Berkeley BART station so it's also a prime location for if you need to commute to the city. The room is huge with a high ceiling so it feels very spacious. Since the ceiling is so high it'd be ideal for a bunk bed setup (right now it's two beds in the room that are being used by the other roommates so you'll need to provide your own bed, but talk with the roomies about getting a bunk and having possible desk space. I was going to do that before I needed to move out). Even with 3 normal beds though there's still plenty of space to get around the room. I was really comfy. Speaking of roomies (2 other girls in this room and 2 in the other room)they are all awesome people and very open minded. I'm sad to leave them which I feel like is rare when you find random roommates to live with. They'll make you feel at home and make sure you're confortable. They're also interesting to talk to but will also give you your own space if you need to unwind and chill by yourself. They're great :) Since the roommates are all girls, a female roommate is preferred. Rent is only 675 a month plus utilities which come out to be from 15-25 per person. Month to month.

We've got a medium room (big enough for a full size bed and a dresser, there's also a closet in the room too) with two windows. There's a big kitchen, a living room and a shared backyard too! Rent is $460 per month Utilities are about $70-120/month. First, last, and a $200 cleaning deposit is needed for move in, The place is in between Temescal and downtown close to the freeway. The rent is quite low but the place has not been renovated in quite sometime. It is a victorian duplex. The landlord will want to see a credit report so only people with fair and above credit need apply. Move-in date May 1st We are a 30-something female and a late 20-something queer POC male. We're both artists and passionate about social justice. We both work jobs (M-F for one and W-Sun for the other). One of us also runs an artist space in Temescal. We are not a party household so no heavy drinking or hard drugs. There a re two rather large AMAZING siamese cats living here also. So you have to be Ok with cats and Ok with having a litter box in the house. 420 friendly. No cigarette smoking, You'd be sharing a bathroom with the 30-something female. We're looking for someone that'd be a good fit. The room is for one person. NO COUPLES and sorry no more pets unless it is a fish or something since there are already two cats. We welcome diversity and strive to create an inclusive household. We keep the common areas clean. We are friendly to one another but also like to come home to unwind so often keep to our rooms. We're located about a 10 minute walk from the MacArthur BART station. Nearby to coffee shops, awesome local restaurants, DIY and artist spaces, etc. There is no dryer/washer in the unit, so you'll have to go to the nearby Laundromat on Telegraph. Obviously this is extremely low rent in Oakland, so we're going to be really selective about who we pick. It's low rent due to it being rent-controlled and entering an agreement years ago (before the housing boom). We're both independent and direct communicators. We're clean too. We are a quieter household but have complete respect and love for each other. You *must*: * Commit to living here for at 6 months * Help clean common spaces and do your fair share * Contribute to a supportive, inclusive space for *all* people It's helpful to include: * Name * Short autobiography * Age * What do you do for work * Why you're looking for a place * What you're looking for in roommates / housing vibe * Why this is a good fit for you * Interesting fact * Any other helpful information (remember, we'll be getting a LOT of e-mails due to low rent, so anything to stand out is helpful--be visual, win our hearts!) * Links to social network *what is you schedule * will you have overnight guests, if so how often ",37.822727,-122.26688

Daniel works in an assistant manager position at Petco.

We're totally not space hogs, so you're welcome to join us! You'll also be living with our 1-year-old pup (Milu) and our 2-year-old kitty (Simba). Milu typically hangs out in her kennel during the day when no one is home and Simba just sleeps around (he's pretty lazy). The pup and kitty are pretty calm. They have occasional spurts of energy, but to help curb that, Milu has a walker that stops by most days of the week. Your bedroom: Is a good sized bedroom. It has a walk-in closet and also a private bathroom and shower. You also get your own balcony :) The community: Is super nice and fairly quiet.

(Electric additional ~$30 monthly, water/trash/internet included.) Your flat mates would be two cis-afab gender nonconforming queerdos and a large dog. Everyone works full time (the dog and his person go to work together) and we keep a relaxed communal space where we are generous and sharing and staunchly against the chore wheel. Our building is less than 1/2 mile from West Oakland bart, and an easy flat mile-or-so to Jack London and the ferry terminal. The bedroom for rent is the largest of the three. It does not get much natural light. It is about 15' x 15'. The apartment has an electric stove and a dishwasher and beautiful hardwood floors. It is on the first floor however there are a few stairs to enter the building. It is not considered a wheelchair accessible unit. We have an upright piano that needs tuning along with a banjo, guitar, some ukuleles, and other assorted musical things. We are home on the weekends sharing drinks, watching movies, and cooking brunch together more than we go out. Once or twice a month we might have a friend sleeping in the living room. One of us has a male partner who stays over occasionally. We are omnivores who consume alcohol and (outdoor only) tobacco smokers. We light candles inside and clean with vinegar as well as bleach. There are indoor plants and herbs growing in the windows. We are considerate of apartment living and generally ""quiet hours"" happen naturally from midnight-8am on weekdays and 1am-9am on weekends. If you have a car, there is off-street parking. You can be anyone as long as you are: a clear communicator who likes radical honesty, able to pass a credit check, comfortable signing a lease (building requirement), an excited about sharing a space with a large sweet dog and two funny late 20's-aged humans. (Bonus points to those comfortable taking a dog out to pee occasionally.) Sorry, no more pets unless they live in an aquarium. Couples welcome to contact us but will be met with skepticism about 4 people sharing one bathroom and there will be a difference in rent. There is a $25 application fee to be paid to the management company, as well as $600 security deposit. Rent is $850 monthly. We are looking for someone to move in May 1st - though we can be a bit flexible on this.

The building was built in 1910 as one of the original homes around Lake Merritt. The neighbors are wonderful people, the house is cozy, and the room available is the only one you can see the lake from. During the summer I regularly barbecue with the upstairs neighbors in the backyard. In the winter I try to host occasional dinner parties with them. Of course, my roommate is more than welcome to partake in the festivities. Also, I occasionally have friends over to have a few beers and cook dinner. Not only would you be welcome, but you're encouraged to have some food and enjoy the company. I am 420 friendly, and an occasional user, but I do ask that only concentrates be used in the house. The house is old and the ceilings/floors between the 3 apartments are thin, the smell permeates to everyone. Plant matter has to be smoked outside. Very spacious, it has the original hardwood flooring from when the house was new. I've included a large wardrobe, and if that isn't enough closet space, the living room closet is yours to use. Also included is cable and internet (including HBO and Showtime, as well as DVR), but you'll have to provide your own TV. There is only 1 shared bathroom, but with my work schedule it hasn't ever been an issue before. I'm usually out of the house very early. Located right in the middle of everything awesome the lake has to offer, I've yet to be really bored in the 4 years I've lived here. There's an amazing little tap room less than a block away, a quaint little coffee shop just across the street, and tons of restaurants and bars within walking distance. There's even a grocery store a block away! While laundry is technically located on the premises, it rarely works. Luckily, there's a laundromat that I regularly use less than a block away. I do have a very friendly labrador in the house who is great with other dogs and people. If you have a dog, even better! He loves the company while I'm at work! I work security, so for a large portion of the day, you'll have the house to yourself. In my free time I like to work on my project car in the back yard or take long walks with my dog. I'm 29, and soon to be going back to school to be an aviation mechanic, so my schedule is about to be even more full. I'm looking to fill the space immediately as my old roommate is moving out on short notice. I apologize that the photos don't illustrate how truly nice or massive the house is. I'm not a photographer, so to really see, you'll have to come see the place for yourself. The empty room pictured is the room for rent. Also pictured is the kitchen, living room, and dining room. Feel free to call or text me with inquiries, I'm generally prompt with my replies. ",37.79998,-122.256084

The condo has a washer and dryer in the unit, as well as an attached two car garage.

Attic is big enough for one or two people. Our house is five people in their mid-20s to mid-30s who have a variety of professions. Everyone has their own schedule. Sometimes people cook together, or just share food, hang out in the common spaces, or just take time to themselves. It is as communal as you want to make it. We are looking for one person or a couple who are kind & conscientious to our housemates and our belongs. We welcome folks of all genders, nations & sexualities. We appreciate and enjoy each other's company, and we're all involved in our own exciting, dynamic communities and projects outside of the house. That is to say - people are always up to share a meal, or give you space to watch Netflix on your own :) Food: We pay $120 per person to cover utilities and FOOD. With the help of a housemate who works at the farmer's market, that money keeps the house stocked with all staples (rice, bread, milk, beans, nuts, spices, oils, vinegars, etc) as well as as much fresh farmers market produce we can eat -- and often cheese, meat, fish, pickles, pastries and other farmer's market goodies. We live on a peaceful tree-lined residential street, and our neighbors are a mix of students and established community members. The house is the oldest on the block, a farmhouse from 1906. The house is centrally-located a few blocks from Telegraph, about a 15-minute walk (5 minute bike) from Ashby BART, downtown Berkeley, and Berkeley Bowl Market - and very near to some rest hiking spots. The house has lots of light and a ton of shared space including a cozy, sunny living room with a working ﬁreplace, a kitchen that loves to be cooked in, a beautiful dark-wooded, potluck-friendly dining room, a half bathroom with an antique pull-chain toilet on the ground ﬂoor, and a full bathroom on the second ﬂoor (total of 2 toilets and one shower). There are six bedrooms, one on the ground floor, four on the second ﬂoor and the attic space which spans the length of the entire house. Our home also has wireless internet, a driveway we share, a free washer and dryer, and secure indoor bike storage. Our landlady is lovely and helpful (we had our kitchen counters updated recently at no cost to us). We maintain and enjoy lush front & back gardens with vegetables, fruit trees, native plants, medicinal and kitchen herbs, and a fire pit. ",37.861983,-122.262323

My name is Matt, and I'm renting out a room in my two bedroom condo (~1500 sq. ft. total). About the room/condo: The room is approximately 12.5'x11' and, while not a master, has a bathroom right outside the door that won't be shared with me (it is sort of the ""guest bathroom""). The condo has a washer and dryer in the unit, as well as an attached two car garage. The room is unfurnished, but the common area/kitchen is furnished with tables, couches, TV, etc. Google maps says it's 1.4 miles/an 8 minute bike ride to Pleasant Hill BART, and is about a 5 minute walk to downtown Pleasant Hill (Century Theaters, Chipotle, Zachary's). About me: I am a 28 year old electronics/embedded hardware engineer at a medical device company in Pleasanton. I grew up in the area, attended UC Berkeley and UCLA, and enjoy Warriors basketball, Cal football, video games, and going to the gym. I'm generally not a loud or boisterous guy, and don't partake in any drugs, but I will occasionally have a couple friends over for a Warriors game and have a beer. The rent is $1100/month, and includes water, PG&E;, garbage, internet (~75-100 mbps), and cable TV in the living room. If you want a cable box in your room, you'll need to pay the extra box fee. In general I think the best fit would be a young professional with a stable job. DVC/college students are welcome to apply if a stable income can be verified/parent can co-sign a lease. No couples please, I'd rather have just one roommate.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/roo/6062496396.html,Building a creative community to create a house in Berkeley or near,,berkeley,2017-05-01,1500,"['no private bath', 'private room']"," Hi good people, We are two friends, male(34 y/o) and female 35(y/o) year old, trying to bring together a small handful of people to make our dream happen: creating a home that is a source of community, creativity and awareness in the East bay, probably Berkeley or near but we are flexible. The goal is to find a place under or around $1000/each, if possible. *Situation: - We have lived in co-ops in the East bay and as much as we enjoy community living, we find it hard to create a deep connection and intention with so many people and so many different interests. Currently we both live in a nice place and can stay until we find the house and community that calls our attention. Ideally, the small community we aspire to find will also be flexible and able to wait until the ideal house appears. But keeping an active search and intention in the meantime. We would like to move somewhere between May 1st or June 1st, July 1st at the latest. *What we want: - To create a smaller house , probably around 4-6 humans (but we are flexible), with shared common ground interests that allow each other to grow, inspire each other and get inspired. Things we want to share with all roommates are a genuine interest for: -COMMUNITY -oh, community is everything and we can create such a beautiful community only with a bit of intention and awareness. - AWARENESS - some meditation practice would be great but not required, mainly just trying not to be a selfish rude egotic person in an active and intentional way. Music people, Yoga people, Healer people, Magical people, all welcome in all ways but being a real down to earth human PLEASE. Real awesome people are humble and down to earth because thats how awesomeness is. - MUSIC AND CREATIVITY- There is no need to be a professional artist, as we are all artists in a way. But being actively passioned and oriented to work in your creativity, no matter how professional or talented you are, will inspire each other and let us all grow in many ways. -NATURE: our house needs to have a backyard. We also owe ourselves to grow some veggies in the measure of our backyard possibilities. And we will love bonfires and singing around them. - Roommates don't necessarily need to be best friends, but we'd like them to be people who we feel connection with, and with whom we can create this shared vision of the world. -Sharing emotions and being honest and passionate, YES. Drama NO, please no drama. *Locations of interest: One of us has to work a few days a week in Oakland and the other works full time in San Francisco but we are really flexible about the location as much as the house and the space feels right. Thinking about Berkeley but open to Emeryville, the hills or Oakland anyway. *Common ground interest? - Yeah well, we all have so many interests but feel naturally attracted to create community through music, awareness, sharing creativity and occasional intentional gatherings (We are not vegan but tend to eat less and less meat these days and we enjoy vegan meals). I feel this is a common ground wide enough to aspire to share it with all housemates. *Who are we? - s, 35 year old, works full time in SF. Very passionate about several art forms: Painting, Music, Dance, Cooking, etc...currently spending most of my free time studying music theory/song writing and practicing the piano. Trying to get back into a regular yoga practice! I also love cooking/sharing meals, hanging out with good people, sharing wine, hiking and occasionally catching up on a good tv series on netflix...Things I treat myself with to unwind from the busy city work life: sensory deprivation tank sessions, acupuncture, meditation and reflexology/massages. - f, 34 year old, is a former writer/journalist in deep love with music and all other arts of creativity as well as nature and cooking, gardening... all ways of enjoying and sharing life. Obviously I also love writing but I do also love any form of creative expression that is honest. Im also reinventing myself and just found me naturally walking on the path of meditation and awareness. I dont want to become a fanatic about this but I feel its necessary certain kind of awareness practice for avoiding being an unaware egotic human- not anyone's fault, just how the mind works. *What kind of people we are looking for? - Anyone who feels real and authentic, you dont have to be supercool, just real. People who dont forget about being humble and nice to others in everyday life. - Just trying to create a humble and harmonious home that is a source of community, sharing creativity (not only MUSIC but so much music please), awareness and passion for connection with nature. -We're mainly pretty flexible about everything else and love to be inspired and surprised so... if you're interested but doubting if you'd be that person... please get in touch, there's nothing to lose! *What you should do? -Well just get in touch and let us know what you think about this, any other ideas or suggestions you may have are really appreciated. If you made it this far you must be interested and should probably send us a hello! Thanks so much for reading! P.S. a quick note to address monetary logistics: financial stability is a must. In this day and age (especially in the bay area) having good credit, solid income and impeccable rental history (i.e. no evictions) is a must for most landlords. Not saying it's a deal breaker for us, but it's definitely important. Please keep that in mind (unless you have some awesome connection to a landlord who won't mind some hiccups in the financial realm and you just happen to be independently wealthy) when replying and be honest with yourself and us.... Cheers! :) ",37.866858,-122.28075

Please get the chance to read this whole ad before you consider responding. I know its long but its good! Thank you so much :-) The Room & Lease. Fully furnished with: night stand, desk, lamp, dresser (with locking drawers!), bed, bedding & wall hangings. Room is 9x10 ft. and has a nice walk in closet with 3 storage shelves. $850/month, plus $100/month flat rate for utilities plus household cleaning supplies, water filters & a many other kitchen use items needing regular replacement (i.e. trash bags, tinfoil, etc.). $950 deposit. Looking for move in April 20th-June 1st but am somewhat flexible for the right person. 6 month lease to start. About our 2 bedroom/1 bath house, One comfortable sunny common room, a gas fireplace, kitchen & dining room, dishwasher, laundry room, yard/gardening space and one shared bathroom. A second connected living room that curtains off the late nights I have my son (half the week) & functions as his bedroom & my guest room, or if I'm not using it, it can be extended common space as needed. Situated on a shared lot with a beautiful courtyard, nice neighbors and many fruit trees. The house is a duplex, & we have the upper/larger half. The neighborhood is transitional, many nice houses with gardens and conscious communal homes, but also among a few apartment complexes and housing to low income families, offering some north Oakland feel. We are walking distance to several cafes, & a community garden. We are biking distance to Ashby Bart or the train station (15-18 min walk) and Berkeley Bowl West (grocery, 12 min walk). Located in East bay on the Oakland, Emeryville, Berkeley boarders (but its technically Oakland). I tried to give a tour via pictures and also showed the cleared cupboards or drawers in the bathroom and kitchen, so you can assess if it is sufficient for your needs. About us, 36 yr. old gal & half each week with a 4 yr. old boy. I am a dancer and performer, though winding down, dancing of many forms has been a passion most my life. I have a friendly outdoor cat (cannot accept more pets). I am responsible. I love nature and the outdoors. I am a healer by nature. I wish to create a home with positive and friendly energy, where social gatherings can be appreciated on occasion, a home with garden space, that is considerate, eco and sustainably minded. I am an exotic dancer by night and an online student for a business degree by day. As much as I love music I hear so much dance music at work that I like home to mostly be a place for less energetic tunes, but I don't usually play them since I'm often doing homework. I don't own or want a TV in the house, but I do sometimes project movies or quality shows, sometimes late night. I might smoke medical marijuana on rare occasions & don't normally drink alcohol at home. I tend to go to sleep very late and wake very late. I am nocturnal, & I am also a light sleeper. I find myself sensitive to synthetic or overly strong scents & so for comfort like to keep home free from them. I can enjoy many different essential oils though ;-). I am friendly and appreciate a connection with anyone I choose to live with, but also am often busy or focused on homework when at home. I have an amazing son of 4 years old who spends half of the week with me and the other half with his father. The half week he spends here he is half that time in daycare, so although this is a child friendly home, it is not a child dominated one. Although all kids have their moments, generally he is an enjoyable little guy. He does not attempt going to bed till 10pm, so the house can be active until that time. About my ideal housemate, I'd prefer to live with someone that identifies in the same gender as I do. I cannot accept couples, children or additional pets, per the master lease. Does not smoke cigarettes. Appreciates cats & is comfortable fostering a relationship with a child. Understanding of temporary messes brought on by a child (I aim for neat & clean, the little guy does not, but he is learning to keep his mess in his room) but holding yourself to higher standards & are neat/clean in common spaces. Considerate, health & eco conscious. Does not snore or if so, no worse than a kittens purr (seriously). Does not generally rise before 8am. Healthy communication skills is essential, friendly, interested in a connection with housemates, & open minded. Financially & emotionally stable & responsible. Age 20-48. You don't 'run hot'.... cause I 'run cold' and so keep the house cozy, temp wise. Hoping to create a connected & respectful vibe where we care for our connection & each other's preferences. Would be great if we can share the cost of a monthly house cleaner (+/-$40 per person per cleaning). Extra points if you like to garden, cook & share meals, or if you have a love for kids/cats :-). There will be a small fee for a background check done by the landlords, so if your accepted by me, that fee and the deposit is needed to assure your place while the background check is completed. If denied for the background check your deposit will be returned in full, but if you back out for non-emergency reasons (i.e. another room option that came available), than half your deposit is forfeit to half months' rent here, while I restart my search for the next month (sucks getting left high and dry). With that in mind, if you have bad credit/bankruptcy without a cosigner, than probably best not to consider here (you must be approved by management). If you think you're a great fit but with a few past and small credit blemishes, lets meet. I realize this is all very detailed but if you meet about 85% than please reach out! If interested please email me a bit about yourself, since I won't consider responses without an intro. A nurturing home is so valuable I do think every ad on craigslist should have this much detail..... Happy hunting! ",37.845579,-122.280922

We are offering one of the rooms for rent in our large old Berkeley home. The house is in the heart of the Gourmet Ghetto and within blocks of the UC Berkeley campus and Downtown Berkeley BART station. Chez Panisse is right around the block, as is the Cheese Board and a number of great supermarkets and farmers' markets. We have a large backyard with a garden, fruit trees, and a fire pit. In the house, there's a washer and dryer, a large and cozy living room, a fully-stocked kitchen with gas stove, sharp knives and a food processor, two full bathrooms, a colorful breakfast room, a guest room, and nearly unlimited storage space. Our porch has a rocking chair and is a great place to hang out during the summer. Hardwood floors throughout. Comcast Business internet/wireless. Parking in driveway. A house cleaner comes by twice a month, so the house is generally very tidy. We have a TV but it is used exclusively to watch streamed series and movies, and we enjoy not having cable or satellite. There's a piano (an old one--think New Orleans brothel circa 1900) if you're musically inclined. The living room also has a fitness pole. If you're into gardening, we have some tools and space in the yard that's available for use, too. We are also making a photo/art studio out of the living room. The Roommates: We are a friendly group of people in our early-20s and early 30s visiting and graduate students and professionals. We share meals with each other, exercise, dance, and host occasional parties both raucous and restrained, but our household is not the only thing in any of our lives. We do play a lot of music and randomly dance. We even have speakers in the shower. We all enjoy the music and quite often shazam it from each other. Kirill: Currently, I spend my days planning or working on random projects, bouldering, going out, and doing outdoors trips. I did a postdoc in theoretical chemistry at UCB and recently quit my job doing machine learning for a customer prediction startup in SOMA. I also tutor sciences on the side. I'm originally from Russia, but I lived on the East Coast for the past ten years. I'm pretty open, social, and flexible. My interests include sports (mma, endurance, yoga, meditation), dance (tango, salsa, clubs), arts, music (DJed on a radio), projects (arduino, web, wearable sensors and machine learning), non-fiction audiobooks and audio-lectures (TTC, HBR, psychology, philosophy, science, biographies, cooking), movies (especially by Herzog and Bergman), figure drawing, and going out. For fun, I look for fun out-of-norm events and explore always changing SF music and art scene. At home, I like to randomly dance while experimenting with healthy cooking, host hackathons, and I like having deep conversations, from time to time. Male,33. https://www.facebook.com/kirill.igumenshchev https://www.flickr.com/photos/17359924@N00/ Ivar: I am 32 year old Estonian male. My dream was to become a world famous artist, but as my parents told me that I can not paint, I became a random chemist. Currently working in UC Berkeley as post-doc but I am spending lot of time with my other personal and non-personal projects (start-up) so someone can think I have a randomizer insomnia. If you like atmospheric electronic music, Detroit techno and snowboarding (i was on estonian national team) -- you are my soulmate. In the bay area, I like to look for artistic events, go to start-up mixers, and organize a trips into the nature. https://www.facebook.com/kruusenberg Urte: I'm an incoming PhD student in philosophy. I did my MSc in cognitive science and psychiatry, undergrad in (psycho)linguistics. That is Edinburgh and Cambridge respectively. Which means I've spent the past few years in the UK, although I'm Lithuanian originally. I'm a bit of a film buff, you might say. Mostly arthouse (Bela Tarr, anyone?) and oldies (German expressionism +). I listen to free-jazz, late classical, also things like gregorian chant, traditional music from all over and so on. Good literature, good nonfiction. I'm almost overly curious, as I'm obsessed with running round open lectures on all sorts of subjects. I suppose I'm interested in everything . . . well, interesting. I used to do a fair amount of contemporary dance. Not so much anymore but I certainly enjoy bursting into a spontaneous dance from time to time. I tend to frequent art galleries, concerts, the theatre and suchlike. Alternatively, just stay in with a massive pot of tea (I mean it) and a book or go for a walk in some forest. https://www.facebook.com/urte.laukaityte https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/laukas Thea: (My room is available from 15th of May 2017! Super cozy with a large bed, study space and a small walk in-closet) I'm a 22 year old international student from Norway, living here for the spring semester 2017. I'm an open, nice person who likes to party just as much as I like staying at home watching series. I'm love playing volleyball(playing competitive at UC Berkeley), I love music, I like all kind of movies, and I love to dance even tho the only dance move I know is ""rolling hips""(it's like a bad version of twerking). I'm up for mini-dance outbursts when my mood is on top, and I love (love love) food. I study a lot so I basically live at the library 70% of the time at the beginning of this semester, but as soon as I've learned how to study smart I'll be around a lot more. I may look like I'm blonde and slightly brainless, but I promise you that I'm not. And I have an awesome sense of humor, and the world's most characteristic laugh. https://www.facebook.com/theakristinj Alice: (I'm here until the start of July, then the best room in the house will be available, but the best person will have gone <3) <3 <3 <3 I'm a biochemist from England currently doing a placement at Novartis (soul-less pharmaceutical corporation). I'm a keen snowboarder and surfer (even though I'm crap at both, I have a terrible sense of balance), love pole dancing, swing dancing and playing the jazz clarinet. I'm a closet GoT, Star Wars and LoZ nerd so be careful on getting me started. I'm part of the hiking society at UCB and I really enjoy chill day trips or longer trips around the country. I also love to experiment with cooking (I'm vegan but please don't let that put you off! I'm really laid back about it but my dishes don't tend to have the variety that yours might!). I also like to go out for fancy drinks and dress up sometimes, as well as being a brit abroad (getting sunburned and complaining about things <3) https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006942467154 Some Important Considerations: - No smoking in the house. No hard drugs. - Sleepover guests are welcomed, either in the individual rooms or, with advance notice and consent, in the guest room or even living room (we have a few large and comfy couches). we also couch surf and airbnb to meet interesting people. - We do a fair amount of cooking in the house, also listen to music while cooking. This often (read: always) results in micro-dance parties. - Ours is a green household. We compost, recycle, and use ecological cleaning products. - Kitchen and common areas need to be clean; however in general, we are really laid back - There is often loud music and dancing. However, people do a fair amount of studying and reading; even law students get their readings done :-) - The house is ""sex positive"" (we don't shame or constrain people's sexual life) and LBGT friendly. - Keep passive aggressiveness to the minimum -- communicate. 2 people with a conflict is a burden for the whole house. What We're Looking for in a Roommate: Our home sometimes feels more like a family than just a shared house. We all really get along and make each other's lives fun and interesting -- it's important to us to find someone who's a good fit. We'd like to find someone who can hold their own in conversation at a dinner party, who can enjoy our random micro-parties, who is considerate and kind, and who will add something to the mix. Previous roommates moved out only for relocation: native esperanto speaker/dj/bio researcher is going back to germany, a writer/visiting student is going back to italy, a research position in genetic anthropology on east coast, McKenzie consultant in renewable bioenergies, Harvard professor of english; we keep in touch and they come to visit us from time to time. They all were up for doing random fun activities, had deep insight knowledge in a few subjects, and supportive of people around them. We are looking for something similar. People that recently moved out (we are looking for something similar): J: I am a 27-year-old Berliner, and I moved to Berkeley almost two years ago to go to Haas. I like electronic music, especially by DJs from Berlin, such as Paul Kalkbrenner, and more than anything I love making coffee with my fancy Italian coffee machine. In my free time, I design dresses and shirts for my own fashion label -- all of it is very frilly. I'd send you the website, but it takes me forever to make anything, because I sew it with my own hands. I am the fashionable person in the house. Also, I make bad decisions. S: I'm a 24 y/o student and researcher currently at UC Berkeley and I'll be attending Yale for grad school starting this fall. I'll be spending the summer traveling and bouldering in California, networking with biotech startups and research groups, and having dinner parties. Before moving to Berkeley I put myself through city college for several years working as a sous chef at a retreat center in the Santa Barbara mountains, and as a horse trainer at various ranches and hunter/jumper farms in SoCal. Since moving to Berkeley I've been doing research determining the genetic diversity of amphibians in modified habitats in the Bay Area while completing my degree in molecular environmental biology. When I'm not studying or in the lab I'm rock climbing (indoor and outdoor, Yosemite is a favorite), cooking (everything!), dancing (salsa and tango), or reading (mostly nonfiction scientific but I also love sci-fi/fantasy). I also love traveling; I've done field work trapping birds in West Africa, this winter I was in Sayulita, Mexico visiting friends, and this summer I'll spend time in Canada rock climbing. L: I am Leo, a 27 visiting student researcher at UCB (Energy Science) from Germany. I love sports, cooking, meeting new people and traveling. I am a DJ beside my studies and play around the world, mostly at the place I stay. I speak three native languages (Polish, German and Esperanto) and some more different levels, so I am very interested in different cultures. I like a clean household, and so I do behave. Room 1 -- $880 Room 2 -- $700 rooms have furniture. room 2 is very small Move in dates are flexible. To move in, you need to deposit a security deposit, which is one month of rent, and a one month of rent. Rent is month-to-month. The rent include a housekeeper to come in every 2 weeks, all utilities, and business internet. If you are interested in the room, please tell us about yourself and what you're looking for. Be descriptive similar to how we described ourselves -- we are looking for fun, clean, and interesting people. The more details you give -- the better; generic emails will probably be ignored. We'll get back to you about interviews, which we're planning to hold soon. ps: here is a poem about our house written by a guy who lived here in the 60s https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8916126/Tillinghast%20-%20Things%20Past.pdf PS: we have a lot of emails and we read them all.

We have one room coming up in our six bedroom house on May 15th for $850.

We are located near 61st and Market in the ""Golden Gate"" part of Oakland on the border of Berkeley and Emeryville. We are a fairly normal house with a good mix of residents. We all work full time and use our home as a place to rest, socialize, and store our stuff. Our house is 420, bike, and LGBTQI friendly. We are currently accepting applicants of all genders and identities. While not a party house we do keep some late hours and light sleepers need not apply. Available room is on the ground floor and some noise from the common areas carries to it but nothing crazy. We have one very well-behaved short-haired cat. Vague summary of your future roommates: T: Works in manufacturing, loves cycling. J: Chef and restaurant manager that throws a mean game of darts. L: Resident tea and coffee expert H: Works at the BEST local bike shop J: Masseuse and expert chiller I: Short haired tabby-cat, weird mix of social-cuddly and skittish-shy.

We are three people, and two dogs: Ellen, Amber, Crystal, Conky, and Kalypso. We live in a lovely 4 bed room, 3 bath house in North Oakland. Our roommate Evelyn recently moved out and we are looking for a 4th person to take her place on May 1st-ish. About the house: 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, a living room, dining area, a good-sized kitchen with a dishwasher and two refrigerators, a garage (we use for bikes and stuff), a small laundry room and a small backyard and front yard. The room for rent is $750, medium sized with a medium sized closet and shares a bathroom with Crystal. The room is right off the living room and near the kitchen so we wouldn't recommend this spot for someone who is a light sleeper. We are a 15-20 minute walk from both Ashby and MacArthur BART. The 12, 18, and 88 bus lines are ½ -2 blocks away. About Us: We keep a clean house and rotating schedule that works pretty well. We're friendly and often hang out in the kitchen. We have dreams of being a house with regular roommate dinners but our schedules don't really let that happen. About Ellen: Ellen owns the house and is a 33 year old white cis female. She works with families experiencing homelessness in San Francisco, loves her job, and works a lot (occasionally from home). On the weekends she likes to sleep in, cook, see friends, dabble in the Community Democracy Project, and ride her bike to the Y. She has ambitious gardening plans. Ellen loves listening to the radio (generally public radio, Nicki Minaj's i Heart Radio station, or KMEL) while cooking and cleaning so hopefully you are okay with that. Shayon is Ellen's boyfriend and he is usually over 3 days a week and Ellen is at his place 1 day a week. Shayon is a nice guy and sometimes he brings us free stuff from Whole Foods, see our fancy shot glasses. About Amber: About Amber: Amber is 29, cis, femme, and throws out the bio ""aspiring pop-intellectual, outreach director, Appalachian feminist libertarian and mom to Kalypso"" on social media. Works at UC Berkeley with folks interested in studying Central & Southwest Asia and North Africa, and travels for work occasionally. She's trying to spend more time out of the office these days, and enjoys being outside, asleep, and with literally all dogs. On weekends she bakes and/or cooks and is always up for sharing, listens to a lot of funny and/or harrowingly dark podcasts, and thinks about how she'd rather be working on her novel. ""Novel,"" more like. She lives upstairs and shares a fridge with the roommate-to-be, and has her own bathroom. About Crystal Cystal is 30, Queer, POC. Works in restaurants/ hospitality industry and likes to cook, ride bikes, and read. About Conky: Conky is just a pretty blonde boy and he ain't got no worries. He's a 12 lbs 4 year old Chihuahua Terrier mix and he and Ellen have have together a year and a half. His favorite things in life are Ellen, cheese, blankets, the heater, dog clothes, pink, green, wrestling with Kalypso and expressing his enthusiasm for life by barking (yeah, it's annoying). Conky is afraid of toys that squeak, aluminum balloons, the neighbor's lawn nativity scene, his own farts, and sometimes the stairs, but other than that, he has no worries. About Kalypo: Kalypso is Amber's 8-pound pup that looks like an ewok and is Conky-tonk's best frenemy. She's a smart, feisty little lady that will bark at you until you pet her (and then bark at you again if you stop), like the true extrovert she is. She's chatty (brr? brr?) and loves tummy rubs, scrambled eggs, her toy monkey, Shayon, and staring out the living room window. She'll be spending the summer with her grandparents in West Virginia, but back home in August. About you: Not a jerk. Experienced dog co-habitator a heavy sleeper. CLEAN (no wet sponges in the sink please). Able to communicate, good sense of humor and all that. Responsible, bills & rent on time etc... Garbage & internet are included. PGE ranges from $25 -$100 a month depending on the season & water is about $50 every other month. Very sorry but we are at animal capacity. If you are interested please write and tell us a little bit about yourself. We'd like to set-up some interviews for this weekend ",,

Available May 1. Please read the whole post before responding to make sure this is the right fit for you. About the room: Bedroom with beautiful backyard view. Slanted ceiling in one part of the room (So if you're super tall be careful). Closet, hardwood floors and some built in drawers in the wall. Can be furnished with a full bed, desk and book case (currently in photos). Upstairs with the other two rooms in the house. About the house: This is an old victorian house with beautiful light and warm vibes. Two stories (all the bedrooms and full bathroom upstairs), a home office, living/dining room, kitchen, pantry and 1/4 bath downstairs. Big backyard perfect for bbqs and summer hang outs, and a beautiful front garden perfect for veggies and flowers. Washer and dryer in house (though dryer is currently broken and we are hoping to replace sometime soon). There are a set of stairs you have to walk up to get into the house as well, just fyi. However, living in an old house has its quirks, so we prefer to have someone who is very conscious about their energy use. We only have 2 breakers for the whole house which means high powered electrical devices don't do well here (i.e.: microwave) and only one person can blow dry their hair at a time. That also means there's only one outlet per room, so BYOEC (bring your own extension cord) ;) There's not a lot of insulation (single pane windows) so it can be hot in the summer and cold in the winter, but I've lived here for 3 years now and it's never been a huge problem. Also because of insulation, the walls are very thin, and you can hear just about everything in this house so we all try to be as quiet as possible during sleeping hours. Just putting these things out there now so no one is surprised. :) About US! You'll be living with two gay women in their late 20's and early 30's. J is a professional LGBTQ photographer and works from home most days (the front room is her office) when she's not on location on a shoot or a wedding. She travels often and loves to cook, is warm and inviting and a total witchy femme (will read your tarot cards if you let her!). She occasionally fosters kittens for the SPCA and hosts queer brunch meet ups and book clubs at the house. G works in tech in SF and is quiet and very sweet. When she's not working she enjoys binge watching greys anatomy and working on home improvement projects. She shares custody of a French bulldog with her ex, so there is a dog here every other month. J and G are really good friends and the housing situation is really inviting and fun. We love doing things together. About you: Looking for a low maintenance, sweet, kind, respectful and clean housemate who has full time employment. We are a really laid back household when it comes to jobs and chores, we ask that whoever moves in next have initiative when it comes to cleaning up after themselves in common areas and treats our home with love and respect. Obviously must be ok with living with two queer women. No pets at this time as we are maxed out. No couples and no smoking cigarettes (420 ok outside of the house). $800 per month rent. Utilities are anywhere from $85-$160 per month depending on if we get billed for water. Working on changing our cable company bc Comcast is so expensive! Utilities include PGE, internet, cable tv and water. Please DM me or comment here if you would like any more info or like to come by and check out the room and meet us! ",37.798327,-122.236079

Please read the ad, and contact to book a walk-through. Ready for move in between now and July 1. Available: Room in spacious 2 bedroom/1 bath flat in West Oakland, near the BART station, the Mandela Parkway promenade, freeway access, and a fantastic food co-op. The house is solar-powered with laundry-to-landscape water recycling, and includes a lovely backyard garden. We're 6 minutes from Downtown Oakland by bike and 10 minutes from San Francisco by train. Seeking the right person to share the house with me and my preschooler (who is at the house half-time, 3-4 nights/week). Me: Dad with regular work schedule. I'm a project manager by day and pre-schooler manager by night. Foodie, crafter/maker with wide range of interests, and sporadic music maker. I care a lot about making the house a calm, cozy, clean, low-key home and having clear and open communication. The Flat: Upper floor of a Victorian-era rooming house. Large sunny living room and bright kitchen. Washer/dryer on premises. Large, wooded oasis back yard shared with owner (a massage therapist and teacher who lives downstairs with her dogs and elderly mother)--established plum, oak and redwood trees (hawks nest in the branches), roses, and succulents. Hardwood floors and lots of nice architectural details. The landlord will be replacing windows over the course of the summer (and there's a plan to paint the flat in the works). There's a laundry-to-landscape hook-up, so I'll provide the laundry soap. Street parking is available, and you'll just need a permit sticker from the City. We'd be sharing the refrigerator and abundant kitchen storage space. It's a fragrance-free (including perfume of any kind, fabric softener, dryer sheets) and non-smoking (inside or outside the house) zone. The Room: The bedroom is 12x15' with a north-facing window. It has a small closet. The room will be unfurnished, but creative solutions can be found if you need a basic set-up. The bathroom is shared, and is next to the room. What's Included: Electricity. This is actually pretty cool. There's a large solar array on the roof and the owners are covering energy cost, along with garbage/recycling/compost pickup. I'm covering the water bill. The Neighborhood: The street is a quiet, tree-lined jewel box of well-maintained homes from the 1890's. It's got a strong community feel, with a diverse range of families, professionals and creatives. As neighbors we know each other, say hi to each other on the street, and watch out for each other. The tech busses stop at the West Oakland BART station. There are very few bars or restaurants within walking distance, but lots of places to go downtown. There are half a dozen churches in walking distance, along with a community vegetable gardens, cafes and organic groceries. Still, this is also a residential street in a large city, so being aware of your surroundings is essential. The Vibe: Drama free. There's a preschooler in the house 3-4 nights a week, including at least one full weekend day. I'm totally committed to making this is a workable situation with you. You: Our ideal roommate can communicate clearly and maintain the common areas (just your stuff, though--not suggesting you pick up after us). You have boundaries and you set boundaries with kindness. You believe in taking care of your home and yourself. You have a stable job outside the house, and a full life with friends and interests. Next Steps: $1100/month, plus first and deposit (1.5 x monthly rent) prior to move-in. Email for application and interview process details. ",,

You will be housemate number seven! It's important to us that you have great communication skills and previous experience living with roommates. We are a somewhat communal house, but we are pretty laid back in terms of house meetings and house dinners. We try to get together at least once a month, and do fun things in addition to taking care of house business. It takes a lot to keep our home clean and cozy. Everyone is expected to do their share of chores throughout the month, but we also have a monthly cleaning service to get into all those little nooks and crannies. We are looking for someone who is self-sufficient and does their own thing, but also contributes to the energy of the house. We love laughing and sharing stories together, cooking delicious, healthy meals in our super spacious kitchen, playing funk & blues music, holding yoga and meditation sessions in the living room and watching the sunset from our stellar deck with a view of the Bay while talking about consciousness. Sometimes we go hiking together in Redwood or Sibley Park, which are both less than a five-minute drive from the house. Traditionally, we enjoy one or two house trips a year to Tahoe or camping! We also have a front yard and back yard with some fruit trees and ample gardening grounds. Bonus points if you have a green thumb! We're looking for someone who is self-motivated and works outside the house (If you work from home, please do not reply). Ideally, you are between the ages of 25-35. It is essential that you have great communication skills! We have a group text that we communicate through and we use it on a pretty regular basis to keep up with what's going on around the house. We're a busy bunch and even though there are seven of us, the house always feels spacious and is usually fairly quiet. A bit about us: C: 27 - About to graduate with her Master's in Integrative Health Studies - interested in bringing mind, body, spirit into health care and exploring alternative and holistic therapies.

Can be found doing a handstand or interpretive dance, en route to hot springs.... D: 28 - Beer Marketing Professional. She enjoys the gym, hiking, beaches, books, travel. Looking for honest, respectful, outgoing housemate that enjoys community living but respects personal and communal space. A: 23 - Musician and Bartender - originally from Nashville, TN. She enjoys poetry, tiny cups, and talking about consciousness and why people do what they do. K: 27 - Painter - Loves climbing, surfing, and snowboarding. Spends most weekends in Tahoe or Yosemite. The room is on the second floor and you will be sharing a bathroom with two other housemates. It comes with a loft for your bed and a gorgeous view of the bay! We are looking for someone who can commit to at least one year. We have one sweet, adorable cat named Rosie and one sweet adorable bunny named Tomato. Unfortunately, the landlord does not allow dogs, but we are open to having another cat if they meet Rosie first and get along. Rent: $800/month + Utilities ($75-100/month) Deposit: $800 Preference to a male applicants to keep our ratio even. No couples. You must pass credit check and you will be signing a lease.

About Us: My husband and I have always lived in a cooperative living situation with friends. Our first cooperative living situation we shared with 4 other friends and after 3 years, we all went our separate ways to pursue our dreams around the world! Now we are trying to develop another awesome cooperative living situation in a different part of Oakland! We are looking for an amazing young adult to join our community and share our space with. We are both in our mid-20s (I'm 26 and Joel is 28) and are both Bay Area natives. We are both teachers in Oakland. I teach high school chemistry and biology and Joel teaches 7th grade, all subjects. When we are not teaching, we are probably traveling, reading, or going on a food adventure. We like to share new experiences with good friends and we're almost always up for a good, laidback time. Joel is also an avid Magic The Gathering (MTG) player, so he frequently goes to Games of Berkeley to draft on Friday nights. Our other housemate is a first-year teacher, teaching middle school math in Oakland. Like my husband and I, he is pretty low-key: enjoys spending time with friends, hiking, and traveling during breaks. Who We're Looking For: We're hoping to find an additional young professional who is open to living cooperatively! What this means is that this house is more than just a space to sleep and eat; it is an open space to build a community and foster connections. If you are interested in this amazing opportunity, shoot me an e-mail telling me about yourself and we can set up an appointment! ",37.779228,-122.180377

When I am home I am working on my garden, reading, playing x-box, watching movies or hanging out with friends. If you rent a room from me that means it is your house too. Guests are welcome and fine but can't have someone else basically living there ( I have had people ask if their girl/boyfriend could crash there every night and that would not work). I can send pictures of the room/ house upon requests. I have my own bathroom attached to the master so yours would be for just you and the occasional guests I have over. Hopefully looking for someone around my age without any pets or kids. May be willing to rent one or both of the rooms to a couple if the people fit well and we can agree on a fair price. Rooms are open now to view,I just want to have the carpets shampooed before anyone else moves into the rooms. Driveway parking with plenty of extra street parking.

For the summer, I am trying to look for a guy who is willing to share my apartment with another roommate for the summer. To be absolutely clear, this indicates SHARING the bedroom (which also serves as the living room), bathroom, kitchen, and closet.

I would highly prefer as well if the move in date was before May 22nd for sake of personal convenience. Monthly rent is $900, and the security deposit is $500. There is also an application fee of $30. Accommodations include internet, gas, electricity, and water. The monthly bill for these accommodations is around $50.

Please know your tenant rights and understand your contract with the landlord and ask if there are rules that he or she is expecting before signing off contracts. Toni Hogan's home was built in the 1950's with no air vents in the bedroom, but just in the common room and the kitchen. A week after I moved in, the outlets in the bedroom I rented blew out and I addressed these issues to her; washer and dryer broke and those were also addressed. Eventually she is going to need to replace her 20 year old water heater because that's also about to break. I wouldn't doubt it if she just bought a refurbished water heater. Being that it was summer, I was preparing for the upcoming winter season, wanting to make sure my outlets get fixed. Toni couldn't afford it and she suggested I open the bedroom door to get heat from the hallway heater. Rules kept changing along the way, right up through February. It was so cold like a meat locker that it got as cold as 57-61 degrees and she would only allow the heater to run for 5 minutes. Pictures and videos to prove of her physically shutting off the heater after 5 minutes. My contract was written ""rent with utilities"", which I paid every month and on time. She wanted to raise the rent by 10% to cover the cost of utilities, which made no sense if NONE of my wall outlets are NOT in working condition. So if you have a phone, laptop, a portable heater, etc, you couldn't charge it unless you take it to the kitchen. I decided to exercise my tenant rights, which she made it impossible for me to live in, she tried to intimidate me, and removed the thermostat so I couldn't get heat at all. I thought this was someone who I thought I would get along with. She was very passive aggressive towards me when her child was around. She did a self-eviction even though I was trying to move out in a quiet fashion, which by the way the 3-days to vacate was defective. Her updated contracts were so inconsistent. I had to call the cops to make sure I will be safe to collect the rest of my belongings. FYI: ""Self eviction"" is illegal and that a landlord must go through the process to file with the courts. I consulted with my attorney and threatened the landlord, Toni with a lawsuit for theft, backpay on rent for non-working outlets, and for sue her for each day she locked me out, among other things, which I have a plethora of proven photos and live videos. I made sure I collected evidence before leaving that unsafe and outdated home. I am pretty sure she will try to find a way to do a temporary fix or ""temporary band-aid"" instead of doing the right thing by getting things fixed around the house like a landlord should do when he/she has a tenant. However, who knows how long anything in that house will last. Her dishwasher broke and she would rather fix that before fixing the washer/dryer and not prioritize when she has tenants. For someone who says they can't afford to fix appliances or maintain the upkeep around the home, she sure can afford to get pedicures and gel manicures. So avoid renting from her or you'll just end up in a war zone with her. BEWARE: None of her ELECTRIC WIRING is NOT grounded, which is a potential fire hazard. I remembered there was a month when I had recently paid rent, only to find out a few days later that our water got shut off. I took a screenshot of the water notice that was outside the door when I arrived home and sent it to her. ",38.2671,-122.0357

We're on 1/2 an acre of land with lots of trees including lots of young fruit trees as well as a nice organic garden. We have a herd of goats as well as a flock of chickens. We're a good fit for someone who wants to try their hand at goat milking and we'd especially like someone who loves to garden. We do ask that house members be willing to put in up to 2 hours a week on house chores and farm/ garden chores. Usually it's about an hour, but we do work parties once a month and that can be a longer stretch. The house is set back from the road and there is very little street noise. It's a great neighborhood for biking, and walking. Close to lots of beautiful parks, just up the hill. Though public transportation is not so close, the freeway is @ a mile away, so access to the bay area is easy if you have a car. BART is @ a 3 mile bike ride away. It's a tough place to live without a car. The house has a dance studio, large living room with a piano, a laundry, 2 shared bathrooms, and a shared kitchen. We are: a musician/ music teacher, a music teacher/violinist/bodyworker, a wilderness skills teacher/ musician, and an acrobat. Ages range from 29-57 Though it's a roomy house, there isn't much extra storage space. We are looking for someone who enjoys gardening and healthy living, who cleans up after themselves as they make their messes, (we like a clean house!) who has a good sense of humor and enjoys light-hearted interaction as well as occasional shared meals. We are not vegetarians. We are a no smoking, no recreational drug household, and there is rarely alcohol consumed here. Do to chemical sensitivities, we strive to use only non-toxic cleaning products, and no scented/ perfumed personal care products. No TV in the common space, though we do have a projector and a screen and enjoy hosting Movie Nights. We're renting a large but odd shaped room with lots of windows, and a separate entrance.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/roo/6101411354.html,A Steal in Downtown Berkeley,965.0,berkeley,2017-06-01,119,"['laundry in bldg', 'no smoking', 'attached garage', 'no private bath', 'private room']"," This room is a steal because I've been here a while and the rent is a few years old. The location is ideal: 3 blocks away from the heart of Downtown Berkeley, the BART station, bus stops, and Trader Joe's, and is about a 20-minute walk to campus. The apartment itself faces west, has a large and bright living room, and includes all (or most) of the basic kitchen and other appliances, furniture, etc. The room itself is unfurnished, but it does have a fairly large built-in closet. One disadvantage is that the two bedrooms are adjacent, and, since the walls are paper-thin, sonic privacy is an issue. As such, I will need this to be a quiet space -- in other words, using headphones, taking long phone calls outside or in the living room, etc (nothing too crazy -- this section is mostly here due to some bad past experiences...). Of course, there is always some wiggle-room, but we can talk about that if we choose to move forward. More about who I am and what I'm looking for: I'm a female PhD student in my thirties, and spend a great deal of time at home. Since I usually work from home, an ideal roommate for me would be someone with a 9-5 job (or an otherwise busy schedule that would give me the space I need to write my dissertation.) In other words, if you're also a homebody, we're probably not a good fit. I prefer not to live with a straight man (another unpleasant past experience), but am willing to make exceptions if the fit is right. I'm looking for someone like-minded, quiet, busy, preferably older than 25, clean, and who has their head on their shoulders. No assholes! And a sense of humor doesn't hurt :) Please note: since the move-in date is at the beginning of summer, visiting scholars etc. are welcome to contact me if they are interested in a short-term lease; ideally, however, I'm looking for something longer-term. If you're planning on moving to Berkeley when the new school year begins and think this might be a good fit for you, please contact me as well -- if I do sublet the room just for the summer, I'll be looking for a roommate again when they leave.

We live in a bright, cozy apartment that's in an amazing area. Targeted move-in date is June 1st. Month-to-month lease with deposit upfront. THE NEIGHBORHOOD: Our location is absolutely incredible. We're one block from Philz Coffee, Cole Coffee, Tara ice cream, a beautiful 24-hour Safeway, and a plethora of other shops and restaurants. We're about a 10-minute walk from the Rockridge BART and a Trader Joe's, and there is a bus stop right outside the apartment. We're also walking distance to the UC Berkeley campus. In case you're not familiar with the Rockridge neighborhood, it's a gorgeous, sunny, tree-lined area packed with great places to eat, drink, read, and shop. THE APARTMENT: This is a 2-bedroom apartment, on the 2nd (top) floor of a fourplex. You'll be taking over the master bedroom, which is huge, with a heater and 2 closets inside. I'm in the smaller bedroom by the kitchen. We'll share the common areas, including a kitchen with granite countertop, a cozy living room, and the bathroom. The common areas will be already furnished; your bedroom will not be. The apartment is very sunny and generally quiet. We also have a back area with a private parking lot (your rent comes with a parking spot!), a private storage space, a private washer and dryer (coin-operated), and a beautiful view of the hills. ME: I'm a 30-ish years old woman who works full-time in downtown San Francisco at a tech startup. Most weekdays I leave the apartment around 8:00 AM and come home in the 7:00 to 9:00 PM range. I'm a respectful housemate who likes to have tidy living spaces without being a neat/clean freak. I've been described by many people as easygoing and a good listener, and I can be playful and punny once you get to know me. I cook a few times a week and sometimes strum my guitar at home, and on weekends and evenings I enjoy eating (at home or out), watching a movie or show, relaxing with a beer or glass of wine, and meeting up with friends (I'm not much of a ""party"" person though so you don't need to worry about me being loud and rowdy). I'm pretty much right in the middle on the introvert-extrovert spectrum. YOU: I get along with most people. What I'm really looking for in a housemate is someone who is easygoing (low maintenance and easy to talk to), respectful and clean without being a neat freak, can enjoy hanging out at home while also having a life outside of the apartment (this includes, ideally, a full-time job), and likes interacting with people without bringing parties home. Being able to pay rent on time is of course a given. We don't need to become best friends but it would be good if we enjoyed each other's company and are able to have open communication since we'll be sharing the same space after all. If you have a partner, s/he is welcome to come over as long as s/he doesn't start resembling a 3rd housemate. The apartment is dog-friendly too so if you have a dog, that's totally awesome as long as you clean up after him/her. If this sounds interesting to you, please reach out and ideally include a brief description about yourself! Targeted move-in date is June 1st. Lease is month-to-month with a deposit upfront.

A perfect situation if you are looking for LOTS OF SPACE. . . GUEST SUITE WITH BATH - $1,250+ A large 13 x 13 first floor bedroom PLUS its own 6 x 9 completely private full bath PLUS it is next to a 10 x 20 semi-private patio. This room is the only room on the first floor which means the whole first floor is practically yours since your room is closest to it and most second floor tenants stay in their rooms when they are at home because they usually choose not to come back downstairs once upstairs... so pretty much half the house is yours by default. A perfect situation if you are looking for PRIVACY... PRIMARY BEDROOM - $750+ A large 14 x 11 second floor bedroom with a semi-private double sink common full bath right next to it and beautiful view green rolling hills of Blackhawk. A perfect situation for COMMUTERS or SAVERS... Would you like to live in a stunning 3,500 square foot Luxury Home located in one of the best and most prestigious neighborhoods in the United States according to Forbes Magazine? I have decided to further my education and attend Law School full-time so I would like to share my gorgeous DANVILLE home (which I have owned since 1991) with a few carefully chosen, friendly and accommodating individuals who want to experience affordable luxury living in the Blackhawk area for less than apartment prices. Each luxurious room is extraordinarily large, freshly re-carpeted, newly re-painted, has a fairly spacious walk-in closet, has wireless high-speed internet connection, cable hook-up, central air conditioning/heating, and cathedral ceilings. It's a place you would be proud to let your friends and colleagues know you live there. Your future home and residence is conveniently located within a block or two away from a Safeway, a CVS pharmacy, Blackhawk Plaza, Blackhawk Movie Theater, many fine restaurants and fast food establishments, a huge community pool (great for doing laps), a park, 3 baseball diamonds, 3 soccer fields, a beach sand volleyball court and a basketball court. You will be within 5 to 15 minutes away Major Freeways (680, 580, 880 and 24 and from the Dublin or the Walnut Creek BART Stations for those who have to commute. You also will be living less than 2 miles from Diablo Valley Community College (DVC) San Ramon Campus for those who want to further their education. For those who love to jog, hike, mountain bike, camp or star gaze, you will be within 5 minutes from the foot of Mount Diablo which is one of the highest peaks in California. Sorry but...NO SMOKERS, OVERNIGHT GUESTS OR PETS...just not a good idea in a multi-tenant shared housing environment. Because I will also be living in the same household as you will be, please be rest assured that I will do my best to make sure that only warm, considerate and trustworthy housemates will be welcomed to live with us. REMEMBER...YOU ARE NOT JUST RENTING A ROOM since you will have access to and use of ALL the common areas of the house, property and community facilities. This means you will also have the FULL benefits of living in a fantastic 3,500 square foot luxury home with all the amenities and prestige that comes with it which you can never get living in an apartment. It's like renting a WHOLE Luxury Home for the relatively small rent you'll be paying...Isn't that a bargain by any standard? A credit and background check and a Tenant risk assessment will determine the level of REFUNDABLE security deposit that will be required - one month's rent for low risk and two month's rent for a higher risk. I am willing to consider applicants who are credit challenged. An annual lease term agreement is the preferred and the standard lease term although shorter lease terms will be considered upon request but only in special circumstances. The cost of all Utilities and WEEKLY maid/maintenance services shall be equally divided among all occupants (around $250 for each occupant per month which includes cable and high-speed/broadband wireless internet and WEEKLY maid/maintenance services that cleans the whole house including your room and bathroom and maintains the grounds). That means you will have no weekly chores to do for yourself or for the household and you don't have to buy all those expensive cleaning tools and supplies which will leave you with more time to rest and enjoy your time off from work. Isn't that a luxury we all want and deserve? ",37.797202,-121.917921

It means letting the dogs outside in the yard when you come home and then calling them back inside (if you arrive home when we are not home). If we're home nothing to do.

I'll have your filthy clothes all sparkling clean, and folded, by the time you get home from work (or school) I make great cocktails, great meals, and I can be pretty pampering, if you like someone catering to you and your needs, you will really like what I can offer. (Besides, there are lots of *perks* that come with living with a subservient, pampering faggot =) If you are truly alpha, and like being in charge, or even having someone you can vent on, this would be a great situation. You can use vulgar, offensive language, assert your dominance over me, and essentially ..use me I'll do the dishes, and pick up after you. That soaking wet towel you used to dry off after showing... I'll take care of that for you. You'll come home and find your bed nicely made, just like a hotel bitch would do =) You will have a nice room, with high speed Comcast. Your monthly rent is $750 Send me a message if you have an alpha brain and you are intrigued. But please do not contact me if this is not a good fit for this situation. (Nothing illegal here.

Lots of deck and private rooftop space that is SO nice in the warm season. It's located very central, close to downtown Oakland, the 580 freeway, and a quick uber to the MacArthur bart station. I have one bedroom to rent, it is fully furnished with a bed and a desk (we can move things around, take a few things out, etc.). I have one little white poodle, named Marshmallow who is very sweet and tends to keep to herself (so no other pets please). There is a great, large kitchen, and dinning area as well as a lovely living room with TV. I own my condo and work to take care of it and hope you will too. Street parking only. Cable, wifi, utilities, etc are all included. The room is available to start for 6 months to see how it goes, with the possibility of making it permanent. Available soon (pref sometime in May)...flexible, just want to make sure the right person moves in ;-) About Me: I'm in my early 30's, I work in marketing and sometimes work from home. I am fun, silly and lighthearted. I am pretty low key, get to bed early and get up early for the most part. I certainly enjoy trashy TV, red wine, brunch, etc. and it would be great to have someone to enjoy those things with occasionally, but also have my own life, friends, etc. I'm very drama free, if there's an issue, let's just talk about it and be flexible/understanding with each other. About You: You are between 25-40, a professional or student who has a formal source of income. You like to go out occasionally but aren't a party animal. You are nice, quiet and respectful and communicate well when you have something that is bothering you. ",37.822927,-122.25098
